Design: A collaborative study of treatment-seeking, 18-to 45-year-old patients followed up with standardized, reliable, and repeated measures of diagnostic remission and relapse and of both global social functioning and sub-types of social functioning. Setting: Nineteen clinical settings (hospital and outpa-tient) in 4 northeastern US cities. Participants: Three study groups, including 175 pa-tients with BPD, 312 with cluster C personality disor-ders, and 95 with MDD but no personality disorder. Main Outcome Measures: The Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders and its follow-along ver-sion (the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders–Follow-Along Version) were used to diag-nose personality disorders and assess changes in them. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Dis-orders and the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evalu-ation were used to diagnose MDD and assess changes in MDD and in social function.},

The authors addresses several areas highlighted in Shaver and Mikulciner's article: emphasis on the value of experimental analysis in attachment study; accessibility of attachment representations to empirical analysis; and emphasis on affect regulation. The authors provide detailed comments on the importance of contributions of social and personality psychology to attachment theory, noting also that these contributions can help preserve the legacy of J. Bowlby and M. Ainsworth and challenge developmentalists working within the secure base framework to be more explicit about what the key postulates of attachment theory are.

@article{Hastings2008,
abstract = {Effective emotion regulation is essential for children's positive development. Polyvagal theory provides a framework for understanding how parasympathetic regulation of cardiac activity contributes to children's adaptive versus maladaptive functioning. Maintenance of cardiac respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) under social challenge should support emotion regulation and behavioral adjustment. Children's effective parasympathetic regulation and behavioral adjustment should be supported by appropriate parental socialization. These proposals were evaluated in a short-term longitudinal study of 94 preschool-aged children. Parenting and basal RSA were measured at home, then 6–10 months later behavioral adjustment and RSA in lab baseline and socially challenging contexts were measured. Children with relatively higher RSA in social challenge than at baseline ($\Delta$RSA) had fewer internalizing problems (IP) and externalizing problems (EP), and better behavioral self-regulation (SR). Mothers who used more negative control had children with lower $\Delta$RSA, more IP and EP, and less SR. Structural equation modeling showed that vagal regulation mediated associations between maternal negative control and children's adjustment; maternal negative control did not predict EP or SR after accounting for $\Delta$RSA. Associations were consistent across boys and girls, with one exception: Higher $\Delta$RSA was significantly associated with fewer EP in boys only. These findings suggest that the practical significance of physiological regulation might be best revealed in ecologically valid procedures, and that children's physiological mechanisms of emotion regulation are shaped by their experiences of parental socialization.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We used giant African pouched rats (Cricetomys gambianus) as land mine-detection animals in Mozambique because they have an excellent sense of smell, weigh too little to activate mines, and are native to sub-Saharan Africa, and therefore are resistant to local parasites and diseases. In 2009 the rats searched 93,400 m 2 of land, finding 41 mines and 54 other explosive devices. Humans with metal detectors found no additional mines. On average, the rats emitted 0.33 false alarm for every 100 m 2 searched, which is below the threshold given by International Mine Action Standards for accrediting mine-detection animals. These findings indicate that Cricetomys are accurate mine-detection animals and merit continued use in this capacity. Military and paramilitary forces have planted millions of land mines since 1900. Many remain and do great harm by denying civilians access to their homes and land, as well as by causing bodily harm, death, and psychological duress. People in more than 70 countries are},

Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent.

@article{Lupyan2015a,
abstract = {The goal of perceptual systems is to allow organisms to adaptively respond to ecologically relevant stimuli. Because all perceptual inputs are ambiguous, perception needs to rely on prior knowledge accumulated over evolutionary and developmental time to turn sensory energy into information useful for guiding behavior. It remains contro-versial whether the guidance of perception extends to cognitive states or is locked up in a Bcognitively impenetrable{\^{}} part of perception. I argue that expectations, knowledge, and task demands can shape perception at multiple levels, leaving no part untouched. The position advocated here is broadly consistent with the notion that perceptual systems strive to minimize prediction error en route to globally optimal solutions (Clark Behavioral and Brain Sciences 36(3):181–204, 2013). On this view, penetrability should be expected whenever constraining lower-level processes by higher level knowledge is minimizes global prediction error. Just as Fodor feared (e.g., Fodor Philosophy of Science 51:23–43, 1984, Philosophy of Science 51:23–43, 1988) cognitive penetration of per-ception threatens theory-neutral observation and the distinction between observation and inference. However, because theories themselves are constrained by the task of mini-mizing prediction error, theory-laden observation turns out to be superior to theory-free observation in turning sensory energy into useful information.},

abstract = {Individuals avoid stimuli which are associated with aversive experience to preserve safety. However, behavioral avoidance also causes impairments and prevents the individual from attaining positive rewards. Little is known about the link between fear acquisition and the development of behavioral avoidance in the presence of potential rewards. Therefore, two experiments investigated the impact of fear conditioning on a subsequent gambling task. In an experimental group (n = 30) advantageous choices (higher reward probability) were linked to a fear-relevant stimulus that was associated with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) during fear conditioning (conditioned stimulus, CS+). A disadvantageous choice (lower reward probability) was, however, linked to a safe stimulus that was never associated with the US (CS-). In a control group (n = 25), fear conditioning was followed by a similar gambling task with novel stimuli. A second experiment focused on individual predictors of avoidant decisions (n = 81). Compared with the control group, individuals in the experimental groups avoided the advantageous CS + choice despite fewer gains. The predictor analysis further clarified that avoidant decisions were pronounced in highly trait anxious participants who exhibited higher fear responses. On the other hand, findings also indicated a reduction in absolute avoidance across the task. Combined, these findings demonstrate that fear conditioning can lead to avoidant decision making, especially in vulnerable individuals. The resulting costs parallel impairments caused by behavioral avoidance. Such an emotional decision-making style may be a link between aversive experience and the development of habitual pathological avoidance. Introducing rewards for approach, however, may counteract avoidant decisions.},

abstract = {Cognitive deficits following acute administration of corticosteroids have been described in experimental animals and humans. In both populations, an inverted-U shape relationship has been reported between the dose of corticosteroids administered and the nature and extent of the cognitive deficits induced by corticosteroids. Further studies in animals have revealed a two-level recognition system for adrenal steroids, which was later more clearly resolved into two receptor types: Type I and Type II adrenal steroid receptors. The demonstration of an inverted-U shape relationship between corticosteroids and cognitive process leads to the question as to whether this relationship is generated via the two receptor types, exerting effects either via competing or opposing processes or via a more synergistic interaction. In this article, we review the effects of corticosteroids on animal and human cognition and propose a theoretical framework that leads to testable predictions regarding the acute effects of corticosteroids on cognitive function. We also discuss some methodological and experimental factors that might explain some discrepancies in data obtained from animals and humans. Furthermore, we suggest new experimental protocols for use in humans, based on animal literature, that could help resolve these discrepancies and assess more clearly the nature of the cognitive deficits induced by acute administration of corticosteroids.},

abstract = {THIS important subject is one in which I feel that the physician interested in allergy and the physician specializing in psychiatry may with mutual profit merge their eforts, at least in certain cases. One knows only too well that there are extremists in both camps who wear blinders and hold too restricted a view. There is the red-hot allergist who has seen the vision and maintains against all comers that allergy is the sine qua non, and in many cases he can prove it. Then there is the psychiatrist who would seem to my manner of thinking to be too anxious to ascribe disease to emotional causes. I agree with Hansen when he says " One finds that points of view which apparently represent op-posite poles can be maintained tenaciously only because neither side has sufficient experience to evaluate critically the arguments adduced by the other". Before proceeding further, it may be per-mitted to recall that bronchial asthma is a symptom-complex manifesting itself in parox-ysms of bronchial constriction which render diffi-cult the passage of air to and from the lungs. This constriction is effected by a neuro-muscular mechanism as the result of exposure to an ex-trinsic foreign protein to which the patient is sensitive or allergic, or to an intrinsic allergen of bacterial nature; or as a reflex response to irritative stimuli in the upper respiratory tract, by way of the vagus nerve; or from other causes. In addition to the spasm of smooth muscle there is also, as part of the allergic reaction, aedema of the bronchial mucosa, and stimulation of the mucous glands in the submucosa, with exudation into the lumen. Bronchial asthma must be con-sidered then as an allergic response, or altered type of reaction in individuals who are sensitive or susceptible to the inhalation or ingestion of foreign proteins or allergens. Exposure may also be by injection, as for instance after bee stings or after an overdose of pollen extract when urticaria and asthma may come on with startling suddenness. Important as is the allergic conception in the etiology of bronchial asthma, one is quick to * Read before the Section of Psychiatry of the Medico-Chirurgical Society, Montreal, January, 1946. acknowledge that there must be other factors in many cases. We have repeatedly studied cases which to the best of our knowledge were due to exposure to an inhalant or food protein and yet attacks did not always ensue from exposure to the specific allergen. In some cases it would appear that a heavy exposure to the allergic sub-stance is required, or that there be a summation of such stimuli, or even a combination of aller-gens. On the other hand some patients only develop asthma after an infectious factor comes into play such as an ordinary cold in the head or an infection in the paranasal sinuses. Twenty years ago Dr. John Freeman of St. Mary's Hos-pital, London, himself a pioneer in allergy, in speaking of these "toxic idiopathies" (spas-modic rhinorrheea and asthma) considered the allergic reaction to the protein irritant as but one of the links in the causal chain which might comprise such other links as the diathesis or heredity, nervous factors and trauma (or the regional factor). We ourselves had come to realize that there must be modifying influences, and had conjectured the possibility of an " aller-gic threshold" beyond which the anaphylactic or allergic waters overflowed, which could be affected by such non-specific factors as fatigue, emotional or psychic causes, constipation, infec-tion and endocrine influences as at menstrual periods and the menopause. French says "It would seem quite possible that emotional dis-turbances might play even a very important role in determining the threshold of sensitivity to the specific allergens". The etiology of asthma in many cases is far from simple. Multiple sensitization is a com-mon finding, not only to related foods and in-halants such as epidermals and pollens, but to divergent substances. We would regard the etiology as an interlocking set of factors corres-ponding to Freeman's causal chain. In the therapy of a given case one may efect a cure or marked amelioration by cutting through one of these links and so freeing our patient.},

abstract = {The evolution of the autonomic nervous system provides an organizing principle to interpret the adaptive significance of physiological responses in promoting social behavior. According to the polyvagal theory, the well-documented phylogenetic shift in neural regulation of the autonomic nervous system passes through three global stages, each with an associated behavioral strategy. The first stage is characterized by a primitive unmyelinated visceral vagus that fosters digestion and responds to threat by depressing metabolic activity. Behaviorally, the first stage is associated with immobilization behaviors. The second stage is characterized by the sympathetic nervous system that is capable of increasing metabolic output and inhibiting the visceral vagus to foster mobilization behaviors necessary for 'fight or flight'. The third stage, unique to mammals, is characterized by a myelinated vagus that can rapidly regulate cardiac output to foster engagement and disengagement with the environment. The mammalian vagus is neuroanatomically linked to the cranial nerves that regulate social engagement via facial expression and vocalization. As the autonomic nervous system changed through the process of evolution, so did the interplay between the autonomic nervous system and the other physiological systems that respond to stress, including the cortex, the hypothalamic᎐pituitary᎐adrenal axis, the neuropeptides of oxytocin and vasopressin, and the immune system. From this phylogenetic orientation, the polyvagal theory proposes a biological basis for social behavior and an intervention strategy to enhance positive social behavior. ᮊ},

abstract = {High prevalence and costs of depression underline the importance of understanding and treating vulnerability factors of depression such as rumination. Given the role of rumination in predicting the onset of new depressive episodes, it is important to learn why previously healthy people start to ruminate. One explanation is provided by the metacognitive model of depression, which assumes that positive beliefs about rumination initiate rumination. However previous research has been predominantly cross-sectional in nature. We investigated the effect of positive beliefs about rumination on engagement in rumination in a longitudinal design and tested the indirect effect of positive beliefs about rumination on depressive symptoms in 60 healthy university students. A hierarchical regression revealed a significant effect of Time 1 (T1) positive beliefs about rumination on Time 2 rumination, even after controlling for T1 rumination. Additionally, an indirect effect of positive beliefs about rumination on depressive symptoms via rumination was confirmed using a multiple regression and a Sobel test. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Results indicated that mixing costs were substantially reduced under task-relevant verbalization and increased under task-irrelevant verbalization. Moreover, age-related differences in mixing costs were increased when the use of inner speech was disrupted and were reduced when participants performed task-relevant verbalization. These findings suggest that verbal self-instructions are a useful tool for retrieving the next task goal and for reducing action-control deficits in younger children and older adults.},

In this study, the authors evaluated the PAX GBG, a commercially available version of the GBG, as it is typically administered in elementary schools. The authors examined standardized reading and mathematics scores across one academic year for 949 students enrolled in the GBG or comparison classrooms. Results showed significant but small effects of the GBG on reading and mathematics. Results were greatest for boys, children with lower achievement scores at baseline, and students from more economically disadvantaged school districts.

abstract = {In this new book Simon Baron-Cohen summarizes the current understanding of autism and Asperger Syndrome. He explains the process of diagnosis, as well as the options for education and intervention for those with these conditions. Taking a lifespan approach, Professor Baron-Cohen considersa how the conditions affect very young children through to adulthood. He also outlines his new Empathizing-Systemizing (ES) theory, which aims to explain all of the psychological features of autistic-spectrum conditions. This book is designed firstly for people with these conditions and their families. It will be useful to clinicians, teachers, and other professionals involved in the care and support of people on the autistic spectrum. The book will also provide an invaluable introduction to the topic for students in the social and biological sciences.},

@article{Clark2013,
abstract = {Brains, it has recently been argued, are essentially prediction machines. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this “hierarchical prediction machine” approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual. The paper ends (sections 4 and 5) by asking how such approaches might impact our more general vision of mind, experience, and agency.},

abstract = {Skinner described behavior analysis as the field of values and purpose. However, he defined these concepts in terms of a history of reinforcement and failed to specify whether and how human and nonhuman values might differ. Human values have been seen as theoretically central within a number of nonbehavioral traditions in psychology, including humanism and positive psychology. However, these approaches have failed to provide explanations of the behaviorenvironment relations involved in valuing that might allow prediction and influence with respect to this phenomenon. Modern clinical behavior analysis in the form of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), however, succeeds in providing a functional definition of human values that meets this latter criterion. ACT is rooted in behavior analysis and relational frame theory (RFT) and defines values in terms of verbally established motivation. ACT empirical research into values has begun to blossom in recent years, and ACT-RFT researchers are currently investigating the concept at the most basic empirical level as well as in the applied clinical arena, heralding new interest in and insight into values within clinical behavioral psychology.},

@article{Rothbart2000,
abstract = {This article reviews how a temperament approach emphasizing biological and developmental processes can integrate constructs from subdisciplines of psychology to further the study of personality. Basic measurement strategies and findings in the investigation of temperament in infancy and childhood are reviewed. These include linkage of temperament dimensions with basic affective-motivational and attentional systems, including positive affecl/approach, fear, frustration/anger, and effortful control. Contributions of biological models that may support these processes are then reviewed. Research indicating how a temperament approach can lead researchers of social and personality development to investigate important person-environment interactions is also discussed. Lastly, adult research suggest-ing links between temperament dispositions and the Big Five personality factors is described. Temperament arises from our genetic endowment. It influences and is influenced by the experience of each individual, and one of its outcomes is the adult personality. An important goal of our research has been to specify processes at the levels of biology and social development that may link a child's early endowment to its later expression as an adult. In this article, we suggest that under-standing temperament is central to understanding personality. In-dividual differences in temperament have implications for devel-opment in infancy and childhood, and they form the core of personality as it develops. Temperament also provides process-oriented models that are often lacking in trait theories of person-ality, by establishing links between individual differences in behavior and their psychological and biological substrates. Tem-perament also can be used to relate human individual differences, through evolutionary models, to individual differences in nonhu-man animals. The purpose of this article is to review our approach to temper-ament research, indicating ways in which thinking about temper-ament can illuminate the understanding of individual differences. Many of the guiding principles of this approach are already famil-iar to personality researchers, because they were laid out by those who helped to develop modern conceptions of personality. Other principles may be less familiar, because they derive more heavily},

abstract = {The existing models and measurement instruments concerning identity appear to primarily focus on adolescence and early adulthood, and studies extending identity research to younger stages of life are scarce. There has been a particular lack of instruments measuring the early stages of identity formation, especially the process of exploration, which has been portrayed as a central process during this particular period of life. Our aim is to help fill the gap in the literature and facilitate further studies of the exploration process by providing an appropriate instrument to measure exploration in breadth during early adolescence. As a coherent and mature sense of identity is closely associated with psychosocial well-being, an effective identity exploration scale will enable researchers to assess the predictors of young adolescents' well-being. We propose a model of identity exploration domains based on the literature and considering 12 exploration domains: physical appearance, free time, family, work, boyfriend-girlfriend relationships, own opinion formation, perception of own place in the life cycle, self-reflection, future, future family, outlook on life, and attitude toward rules. The study was conducted on a group of N = 454 adolescents (50{\%} males, M age = 13.04, SD = 0.98). Both reliability and structural validity, as verified by confirmatory factor analysis were satisfactory. The instrument is invariant across gender groups at the scalar level of measurement invariance.},

AEDP's stance and techniques aim to (a) foster attachment security through the clinical process, and (b) harness the transformative resilience of secure attachment to potentiate deep and lasting psychological change. Viewing secure attachment as a transformative experience, case vignettes offer examples of AEDP attachment-based work: moment-to-moment experiential work processing attachment security as a powerful new experience; and then, its metatherapeutic processing. Integrating a new, positive relational experience in the here-and-now organically evokes the painful experiences of the original relational trauma. Thus, traumatic memories are also worked through in the service of positive psychological transformation.},

These are long-standing questions that have proven difficult to answer. To test between competing hypotheses, we constructed a massive repository of historical and archaeological information known as "Seshat: Global History Databank." We systematically coded data on 414 societies from 30 regions around the world spanning the last 10,000 years. We were able to capture information on 51 variables reflecting nine characteristics of human societies, such as social scale, economy, features of governance, and information systems. Our analyses revealed that these different characteristics show strong relationships with each other and that a single principal component captures around three-quarters of the observed variation. Furthermore, we found that different characteristics of social complexity are highly predictable across different world regions. These results suggest that key aspects of social organization are functionally related and do indeed coevolve in predictable ways. Our findings highlight the power of the sciences and humanities working together to rigorously test hypotheses about general rules that may have shaped human history.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate measures of cardiac activity and reactivity as prospective biomarkers of treatment response to an empirically supported behavioral intervention for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHOD: Cardiac preejection period (PEP), an index of sympathetic-linked cardiac activity, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), an index of parasympathetic-linked cardiac activity, were assessed among 99 preschool children (ages 4-6 years) with ADHD both at rest and in response to behavioral challenge, before participants and their parents completed 1 of 2 versions of the Incredible Years parent and child interventions. RESULTS: Main effects of PEP activity and reactivity and of RSA activity and reactivity were found. Although samplewide improvements in behavior were observed at posttreatment, those who exhibited lengthened cardiac PEP at rest and reduced PEP reactivity to incentives scored higher on measures of conduct problems and aggression both before and after treatment. In contrast, children who exhibited lower baseline RSA and greater RSA withdrawal scored lower on prosocial behavior before and after treatment. Finally, children who exhibited greater RSA withdrawal scored lower on emotion regulation before and after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss these findings in terms of (a) individual differences in underlying neurobiological systems subserving appetitive (i.e., approach) motivation, emotion regulation, and social affiliation and (b) the need to develop more intensive interventions targeting neurobiologically vulnerable children.},

abstract = {Objective: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) describes a condition that is primarily characterized by fatigue and flu-like symptoms that are not alleviated by rest. This study investigated the relationship among metacognitions, negative emotions, and symptom severity in CFS. Methods: A total of 96 patients who had received a diagnosis of CFS according to the Oxford Criteria completed a battery of self-report measures that consisted of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, the 30-Item Metacognitions Questionnaire, the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ), and the RAND 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey-Physical Functioning. Results: Correlation analyses showed that negative emotions and metacognitions were positively correlated with measures of symptom severity and that metacognitions were a better predictor of symptom severity than anxiety and depression. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that (1) lack of cognitive confidence predicted both mental and physical factors of the CFQ and physical functioning independently of negative emotions and (2) beliefs about the need to control thoughts predicted the mental factor of the CFQ independently of negative emotions and lack of cognitive confidence. Conclusion: The data support the potential application of the metacognitive model of psychological disorder to understanding CFS. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

There are hundreds of millions of individuals suffering from major depression disorder all over the world. This leads to a considerable portion of the economy going for treatment as large amounts of money are spent on drugs every year. Pharmaceutical drugs are not very effective and they also have side effects that compound the problem. There are number of studies which shows that omega-3 fatty acids are proving to be very effective against the treatment of major depression disorder and other psychiatric disorders. However, the data regarding the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in depression treatment are conflicted. This article reviews the recent research showing the relation between omega-3 fatty acids and depression. The roles of the omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of depression are being studied with increased pace in the last decade due to heightened prevalence of depression. It is emphasized that omega-3 fatty acids have no record of associated side effects, which deserves greater attention for further research.},

Questions about the neural bases of emotion regulation have recently taken on new import-ance, as functional imaging studies in humans have permitted direct investigation of control strategies that draw upon higher cognitive processes difficult to study in nonhumans. Such studies have examined (1) control-ling attention to, and (2) cognitively changing the meaning of, emotionally evocative stimuli. These two forms of emotion regulation depend upon interactions between prefrontal and cingulate control systems and cortical and subcortical emotion-generative systems. Taken together, the results suggest a functional archi-tecture for the cognitive control of emotion that dove-tails with findings from other human and nonhuman research on emotion.},

The issues of measurement and intervention, which have been crucial to the evolution of identity as a researchable construct, are also reviewed. The alternative theories are conceptualized as addressing aspects of Erikson's work that were not addressed by Marcia's identity status model. To facilitate the broadening of identity theory to include more of Erikson's ideas, taxonomies for understanding relations among the alternative theories, and a system for integrating them, is introduced. Finally, suggestions for the development of future identity theory and research are offered.},

abstract = {Background: There are now a substantial number of controlled trials investigating the efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). This meta-analysis combined multiple well-controlled studies to help clarify the overall impact of ACT relative to waiting lists, psychological placebos, treatment as usual, and established therapies. Method: A comprehensive literature search produced 18 randomized controlled trials (n = 917) that were included in the final analyses. Effect size was computed with Hedges's g which can be interpreted with Cohen's convention of small (0.2), medium (0.5), and large (0.8) effects. Results: There was a clear overall advantage of ACT compared to control conditions (effect size = 0.42). The average ACT-treated participant was more improved than 66{\%} of the participants in the control conditions. Analyzed separately ACT was superior to waiting lists and psychological placebos (effect size = 0.68) and treatment as usual (effect size = 0.42). However, ACT was not significantly more effective than established treatments (effect size = 0.18, p = 0.13). Also, ACT was not superior to control conditions for the distress problems (anxiety/depression: effect size = 0.03, p = 0.84). Conclusions: The results reveal that ACT is more effective than control conditions for several problem domains, but there is no evidence yet that ACT is more effective than established treatments.

In particular, therapist-guided Internet treatments have been found to be effective for a wide range of psychiatric and somatic conditions in well over 100 controlled trials. These treatments require (a) a secure web platform, (b) robust assessment procedures, (c) treatment contents that can be text based or offered in other formats, and (d) a therapist role that differs from that in face-to-face therapy. Studies suggest that guided Internet treatments can be as effective as face-to-face treatments, lead to sustained improvements, work in clinically representative conditions, and probably are cost-effective. Despite these research findings, Internet treatment is not yet disseminated in most places, and clinical psychologists should consider using modern information technology and evidence-based treatment programs as a complement to their other services, even though there will always be clients for whom face-to-face treatment is the best option.},

To address these gaps, we applied latent variable analyses to (a) experimental data gathered from a socially diverse sample (N= 101, 60 boys and 41 girls) at 3 and 6 years of age and (b) transcript-based coding of children's dyadic interactions with a best friend at age 6. Our results showed significant stability between latent factors of false belief understanding at ages 3 and 6 even with effects of verbal ability and inhibitory control controlled at both time points. In addition, false belief understanding at ages 3 and 6 showed both distal and proximal links with the frequency of children's talk about mental states at age 6 even when their overall talk and their friends' mental state talk were also controlled. We conclude that preschoolers' false belief understanding both directly and indirectly supports children's growing ability to discuss thoughts and feelings in their conversations with friends. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

An emerging treatment approach, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), holds prom-ise as a treatment for Internet pornography viewing because of its focus on processes hypothesized to underlie this maladaptive behavior. In the first experiment on the treatment of problematic Internet pornography viewing, 6 adult males who reported that their Internet pornography viewing was affecting their quality of life were treated in eight 1.5-hour sessions of ACT for problematic pornography viewing. The effects of the intervention were assessed in a multiple-baseline-across-participants design with time view-ing pornography as the dependent variable. Treatment resulted in an 85{\%} reduction in viewing at posttreatment with results being maintained at 3-month follow-up (83{\%} reduction). Increases were seen on measures of quality of life, and reductions were seen on measures of OCD and scrupulosity. Weekly measures of ACT-consistent processes showed reductions that corresponded with reductions in viewing. Large reductions were seen on a measure of psychological flexibility, and minor reductions were seen on measures of thought-action fusion and thought control. Overall, results suggest the promise of ACT as a treatment for problematic Internet pornography viewing and the value of future randomized trials of this approach.},

Schema Therapy is an integrative psychotherapeutic model that systematically assembles elements from gestalt, object relations, psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, and emotion-focused therapies into an innovative and comprehensive conceptual model and treatment approach for working with some of the most challenging patient populations. One of the most profound innovations is the concept of limited re-parenting, whereby a high degree of emphasis is placed on early unmet needs. This needs-meeting approach happens within the appropriate limits of the therapy relationship. The thera-pist acts as a healthy and adaptive parent in an effort to meet the needs of the lonely, abandoned, vulnerable child side and to strengthen the healthy adult side of the patient's personality to ulti-mately meet the needs of this vulnerable part. Schema Therapy has been adopted by clinicians in approximately 40 countries worldwide. This model has shown success in clinical trials with a Cluster B personality disorder—borderline personality disorder. Researchers in the Netherlands conducted a large-scale study comparing treat-ments for borderline personality disorder. Eighty-six patients were recruited from four mental health institutes in the Netherlands. The Dutch investigators Josephine Giesen-Bloo and Arnoud Arntz, along with others, compared Schema Therapy with Transference Focused Psychotherapy (TFP). Investigators concluded that both treatments demonstrated positive effects, but Schema Therapy was clearly the more successful treatment model (Giesen-Bloo et al., 2006). Although no specifi c clinical trials have been conducted on other Cluster B personality disorders, including narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), the clinical use of Schema Therapy for treating NPD suggests that it might have some success. In this chapter, we describe the basic processes of Schema Therapy, and then discuss exactly how this can be applied to the treatment of NPD. EARLY MALADAPTIVE SCHEMAS At the core of Schema Therapy is the concept of early maladaptive schemas. These are defi ned as " broad, pervasive themes regarding oneself and one's relationship with others, developed during childhood and elaborated throughout one's lifetime, and dysfunctional to a signifi cant degree " (Young 1999, 2003). Young hypothesized that noxious and neglectful childhood experiences—whereby the child's psychological, emotional, and physical needs are not being adequately met and where secure attachment is compromised—combined with the unique temperament and biologic makeup of},

Three of the sins concern different types of forgetting (transience, absent-mindedness, and blocking), three concern different types of distortion (misattribution, suggestibility, and bias), and one concerns intrusive memories (persistence). We focus in particular on two of the distortion-related sins, misattribution and bias. By describing cognitive, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging studies that illuminate these memory sins, we consider how they might bear on the relation between memory and self.},

abstract = {Why did you choose to come and hear this talk? What am I going to say? What do you already know about Socratic questioning? Don't you think it is a mistake to ask questions without a goal in mind? These are all questions. Are they equally useful questions? I don't think so. When I first began doing cognitive therapy fifteen years ago, I thought the Socratic questioning process was the most intriguing part of the therapy. I still do. Today you will hear the best questions I've been asked about Socratic questioning and the paths I've followed to answer them. I will assert that some questions are better than others, that it is possible to develop guidelines to help therapists and clients learn to use Socratic questions more effectively, and that it is important we answer the question, "Is the primary purpose of Socratic questioning to change minds or to guide discovery?" My thinking for this talk actually began in 1986. By then I had attained sufficient skill as a cognitive therapist that therapists began asking me, "How do you know what questions to ask?" Somehow, responding that the questions just intuitively "popped into my head" did not seem a satisfactory answer. And yet, for me and, I suspect, for many other skilled therapists, it was hard to articulate how I thought of the questions I asked. This question posed to me seven years ago, "How do you know what questions to ask?" has guided my own learning as a therapist and teacher of Cognitive Therapy more than any other. It is a tribute to the power of a well-timed question that I have been stimulated by this simple query to engage in extensive observation of myself and other therapists for seven years in search of a satisfactory answer. Of course, therapists studying cognitive therapy with me continued to pose the question. For awhile, I answered my students' curiosity by providing lists of questions that could be asked in therapy. Then we would develop rationales in our training programs for why one question would be better to ask first and another later and yet another not asked at all. This collaborative process between us led to the development of a list of good Socratic questions that were generic in nature and generally led the client to discovering useful information. Typical Socratic questions on the "good" list included: Have you ever been in similar circumstances before? What did you do? How did that turn out? What do you know now that you didn't know then? What would you advise a friend who told you something similar? This strategy of listing good questions to ask was a useful one. I discovered that it was not only helpful to therapists learning cognitive therapy, but I began giving these questions to clients and found that these same questions helped clients generate alternative responses on their written automatic thought records. So, as I became more aware of what questions I tended to ask again and again, this knowledge could be shared with other therapists and clients. But the question asked in 1986 continued to roll around in my mind. "How do I know what questions to ask?" Although beginning students of Cognitive Therapy were quite satisfied with my list of "good questions to ask," more advanced therapists were quite aware that these generic questions were not enough. I didn't simply ask these questions over and over again. I asked hundreds of different questions and different questions with each client. Where did these questions come from? And was there any pattern to the questions I asked when I was doing therapy well? Approximately 100,000 therapeutic questions later, I have discovered some patterns in my own questions. Watching myself and other experienced cognitive therapists on videotape, I think these simple patterns might serve as a beginning to a clearer articulation of what is involved in good Socratic questioning within a cognitive therapy context. Therefore, I will offer guidelines tonight for therapists who wish to improve their Socratic questioning skills. But before doing that, I'm going to digress to discuss the purpose of Socratic questioning. I began thinking about this in 1990 when a therapist wrote me after a large workshop and asked for written references on Socratic questioning. In particular, he wanted some written descriptions of how Socratic questioning was defined in Cognitive Therapy and some examples and guidelines of how to do it.},

The construct emerged from the self- regulatory information processing theory of emotional disorder (Wells {\&} Matthews, 1994), and is viewed as a metacognitive state that facilitates change in core underlying pathological processes. Detached mindfulness has multiple components, requiring the activation of metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive monitoring and control, suspension of conceptual processing, attentional flexibility, and a de-centered relationship with thoughts. A model of the cognitive structures and processes supporting the state is presented. Implications of the model for the scientific development and effective use of mindfulness techniques are discussed.

@article{Kircanski2012,
abstract = {Background and objectives: Traditional models and methods of exposure therapy utilize a fear hierarchy, whereby patients complete sets of exposures in a graduated manner, with the goal of fear habituation within and between sessions. In the current experiment, we examined whether this typical exposure paradigm was necessary to achieve clinical improvement. Method: Fifty undergraduate participants scoring in the top quartile of a self-report measure of contamination fears were randomly assigned to one of two groups: blocked and constant exposure (BC Group) and random and variable exposure (RV Group). Both groups completed three weekly sessions of exposure treatment, with subjective and psychophysiological indices of fear recorded throughout. Subjective, behavioral, and psychophysiological dependent measures were evaluated by an independent assessor at pre-treatment (PRE), post-treatment (POST), and two-week follow-up (2WFU). Results: Both the BC Group and RV Group exhibited decreases in subjective fear from PRE to POST and 2WFU, with no significant differences between groups. Partialing group, greater variability in subjective fear during exposure predicted lower subjective fear at 2WFU. Limitations: Despite significant findings for subjective fear, behavioral and psychophysiological findings were limited. Follow-up studies should investigate questions regarding traditional exposure within a clinical group. Conclusions: These results support the notion that traditional exposure is sufficient, but not necessary, to produce clinical improvement in contamination-related fears. There may be benefits to variability in fear level during exposure, and evaluation of emotion variability during exposure therapy for other anxiety disorders is warranted. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In psychophysical studies of the relation between perceived magnitude and physical stimulus, interest has focused on the preciseness of growth functions.

In this article, the Category (C)-Ratio (R) (CR) scaling methodology, developed by Borg (1973, 1977, 1982) is presented together with a new CR scale: the CR100 scale. In an experiment on perceived exertion, CR100 was compared with Absolute Magnitude Estimation (AME). Perceived exertion has the advantage of having easily measured physiological variables that can function as validity criteria. 32 persons (16 men and 16 women) participated as subjects on two different occasions, and the presentation order was counterbalanced. Results from CR100 and AME could be described equally well with psychophysical functions. The exponents obtained with CR100 were n = 1.60 for women and n = 1.69 for men, and the corresponding exponents for AME were n = 1.60 for women and n = 1.46 for men (with a "noise" constant included in the function). ANOVA showed that CR100 could make the predicted differentiation between sexes, whereas AME could not. This drawback with AME was also found when using the methods to predict working capacity.},

This study estimated prevalence, comorbidity, and correlates of this proposed disorder in the community.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: Prevalence rates were estimated using data from three community studies involving 7,881 observations of 3,258 participants from 2 to 17 years old. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was diagnosed using structured psychiatric interviews.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Three-month prevalence rates for meeting criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder ranged from 0.8{\%} to 3.3{\%}, with the highest rate in preschoolers. Rates dropped slightly with the strict application of the exclusion criterion, but they were largely unaffected by the application of onset and duration criteria. Disruptive mood dysregulation co-occurred with all common psychiatric disorders. The highest levels of co-occurrence were with depressive disorders (odds ratios between 9.9 and 23.5) and oppositional defiant disorder (odds ratios between 52.9 and 103.0). Disruptive mood dysregulation occurred with another disorder 62{\%}-92{\%} of the time, and it occurred with both an emotional and a behavioral disorder 32{\%}-68{\%} of the time. Affected children displayed elevated rates of social impairments, school suspension, service use, and poverty.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is relatively uncommon after early childhood, frequently co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders, and meets common standards for psychiatric "caseness." This disorder identifies children with severe levels of both emotional and behavioral dysregulation.},

abstract = {We asked whether the structural heterogeneity of the hippocampal CA3-CA2 axis is reflected in how space is mapped onto place cells in CA3-CA2. Place fields were smaller and sharper in proximal CA3 than in distal CA3 and CA2. The proximodistal shift was accompanied by a progressive loss in the ability of place cells to distinguish configurations of the same spatial environment, as well as a reduction in the extent to which place cells formed uncorrelated representations for different environments. The transition to similar representations was nonlinear, with the sharpest drop in distal CA3. These functional changes along the CA3-CA2 axis mirror gradients in gene expression and connectivity that partly override cytoarchitectonic boundaries between the subfields of the hippocampus. The results point to the CA3-CA2 axis as a functionally graded system with powerful pattern separation at the proximal end, near the dentate gyrus, and stronger pattern completion at the CA2 end. Lu et al. show that ensemble activity of hippocampal place cells is topographically organized along the CA3-to-CA2 axis, with strong pattern separation near the dentate gyrus and strong pattern completion in and near CA2.},

The most widely used task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses use parametric statistical methods that depend on a variety of assumptions. In this work, we use real restingstate data and a total of 3 million random task group analyses to compute empirical familywise error rates for the fMRI software packages SPM, FSL, and AFNI, as well as a nonparametric permutation method. For a nominal familywise error rate of 5{\%}, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the field of neuroimaging. fMRI | statistics | false positives | cluster inference | permutation test},

abstract = {Background: While short-term psychodynamic psychotherapies have been shown effective for major depres-sion, it is unclear if this could be a treatment of choice for depressed patients, many of whom have chronic and complex health issues, who have not sufficiently responded to treatment. Method: This superiority trial used a single blind randomised parallel group design to test the efficacy of time-limited Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) for treatment resistant depression (TRD). Patients referred to secondary care community mental health teams (CMHT) who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode, had received antidepressant treatment ≥6 weeks, and had Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores of ≥16 were recruited. The effects of 20 sessions of ISTDP were judged through comparison against secondary care CMHT treatment as usual (TAU). The primary outcome was HAM-D scores at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) self-report measures for depression and dichotomous measures of both remission (defined as HAM-D score ≤7) and partial remission (defined as HAM-D score ≤12). Results: Sixty patients were randomised to 2 groups (ISTDP = 30 and TAU = 30), with data collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Multi-level linear regression modelling showed that change over time on both depression scales was significantly greater in the ISTDP group in comparison to TAU. Statistically significant between-group treatment differences, in the moderate to large range, favouring ISTDP, were observed on both the observer rated (Cohen's d = 0.75) and self-report measures (Cohen's d = 0.85) of depression. Relative to TAU, patients in the ISTDP group were significantly more likely after 6 months to achieve complete remission (36.0{\%} vs. 3.7{\%}) and partial remission (48.0{\%} vs. 18.5{\%}). Limitations: It is unclear if the results are generalizable to other providers, geographical locations and cultures. Conclusions: Time-limited ISTDP appears an effective treatment option for TRD, showing large advantages over routine treatment delivered by secondary care services.},

The revised version was labelled The Swedish universities Scales of Personality (SSP) and now include 91 items divided into 13 scales. METHOD: The SSP were evaluated in a normative, randomly drawn sample (n = 741). All scales were found to be approximately normally distributed. RESULTS: The Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranged from 0.59 to 0.84. The mean inter-item correlations (MIIC) ranged from 0.17 to 0.43. The scale intercorrelation matrix yielded a three-factor solution with Factor 1 reflecting Neuroticism; Factor 2 Aggressiveness; and Factor 3 reflecting Extraversion. CONCLUSION: The original KSP scales were revised, shortened, modernized and psychometrically evaluated. The psychometric properties and the usefulness of the test battery were found to be substantially improved.},

@article{Wen2005,
abstract = {A ubiquitous feature of the vertebrate anatomy is the segregation of the brain into white and gray matter. Assuming that evolution maximized brain functionality, what is the reason for such segregation? To answer this question, we posit that brain functionality requires high interconnectivity and short conduction delays. Based on this assumption we searched for the optimal brain architecture by comparing different candidate designs. We found that the optimal design depends on the number of neurons, interneuronal connectivity, and axon diameter. In particular, the requirement to connect neurons with many fast axons drives the segregation of the brain into white and gray matter. These results provide a possible explanation for the structure of various regions of the vertebrate brain, such as the mammalian neocortex and neostriatum, the avian telencephalon, and the spinal cord.},

abstract = { Background: Over half of children in the general population report unusual or “psychotic-like” experiences (PLEs). The development of a later at-risk mental state is associated with persistent, distressing, PLEs, which are appraised negatively and hard to cope with. We have designed a novel, manualized, cognitive behavioural intervention for children aged 9 to 14 years, which aims to reduce emotional problems, improve coping and resilience, and help children manage PLEs, before an identifiable psychosis risk develops. We report on the feasibility, acceptability and clinical impact of the intervention. Method: Four children who reported PLEs and emotional problems in a community survey completed the intervention, and gave detailed feedback. Clinical outcomes were assessed before, during, and after therapy. Results: Emotional problems, PLE frequency, and PLE impact all decreased during the intervention. Child and therapist satisfaction with the treatment was high. Conclusions: It is feasible, acceptable and helpful to offer psychological interventions to children who report emotional distress and PLEs, prior to the emergence of clear risk factors. Our intervention has the potential to increase resilience to the development of future mental health problems. A larger, randomized controlled evaluation is underway. },

@misc{Ekman1999,
abstract = {In this chapter I consolidate my previous writings about basic emotions (Ekman, 1984, 1992a, 1992b) and introduce a few changes in my thinking. My views over the past 40 years have changed radically from my initial view (Ekman, 1957) that: (a) a pleasantunpleasant and activepassive scale were sufficient to capture the differences among emotions; and (b) the relationship between a facial configuration and what it signified is socially learned and culturally variable. I was forced to adopt the opposite view by findings from my own and others crosscultural studies of facial expressions. There are some who have challenged this by now quite large body of evidence: I describe those challenges and the answers to them in Chapter 16. The framework I describe below is most influenced by Darwin (1872/1997) and Tomkins (1962), although I do not accept in total what either said. There are three meanings of the term basic (see also Ortony {\&} Turner, 1990). First, it distinguishes those who maintain that there are a number of separate emotions, that differ one from another in important ways. From this perspective, fear, anger, disgust, sadness and contempt, all negative emotions, differ in their appraisal, antecedent events, probable behavioral response, physiology and other characteristics described below. So, too, amusement, pride in achievement, satisfaction, relief and contentment, all positive emotions, differ from each other. This basic emotions perspective is in contrast to those who treat emotions as fundamentally the same, differing only in terms of intensity or pleasantness.},

Data were collected from 122 preschool children (57 boys, 65 girls; 86 European American, 9 African American, 17 Hispanic, and 10 other ethnicity) over a 2-year period. Children participated in emotion knowledge interviews, mothers rated children's emotion regulation skill, and observations were conducted of children's emotional expressiveness with peers in both Years 1 and 2. Naturalistic observations of children's peer play behavior were conducted to assess the proportion of time children spend in pretend and physical play in Year 1. Analyses revealed that sociodramatic play predicted children's emotional expressiveness, emotion knowledge, and emotion regulation 1 year later, after controlling for Year 1 ASC skills. Rough-and-tumble play predicted children's emotional expressiveness and emotion regulation 1 year later, whereas exercise play predicted only emotion regulation. Some associations between sociodramatic play and rough-and-tumble play and children's ASC were moderated by gender. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Despite strong support for the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD), little is known about mechanisms of change in treatment. Within the context of a randomized controlled trial of CBT, this study examined patients' beliefs about the fixed versus malleable nature of anxiety-their 'implicit theories'-as a key variable in CBT for SAD. Compared to waitlist (n ¼ 29; 58{\%} female), CBT (n ¼ 24; 52{\%} female) led to significantly lower levels of fixed beliefs about anxiety (M baseline ¼ 11.70 vs. M Post ¼ 7.08, d ¼ 1.27). These implicit beliefs indirectly explained CBT-related changes in social anxiety symptoms (k 2 ¼ .28, [95{\%} CI ¼ 0.12, 0.46]). Implicit beliefs also uniquely predicted treatment outcomes when controlling for baseline social anxiety and other kinds of maladaptive beliefs (perceived social costs, perceived social self-efficacy, and maladaptive interpersonal beliefs). Finally, implicit beliefs continued to predict social anxiety symptoms at 12 months post-treatment. These findings suggest that changes in patients' beliefs about their emotions may play an important role in CBT for SAD.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Objective: To examine the relationship of poor dental health and depression, controlling for markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein; CRP) and adiposity (body mass index; BMI). Method: Data from two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2005–2008) were utilized (n=10 214). Dental health was assessed using the Oral Health Questionnaire (OHQ). Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), where cases were identified using a cut off score of 10 or above. Logistic regression was applied to measure magnitude of associations, controlling for a range of covariates including CRP and BMI. Results: After adjustment for covariates, a significant dose–response relationship between number of oral health conditions and likelihood of PHQ-9 defined depression was observed. Compared with individuals without an oral health condition, adjusted odds ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) for depression in those with two, four and six conditions were 1.60 (1.08–2.38), 2.13 (1.46–3.11) and 3.94 (2.72–5.72), respectively. Level of CRP and being underweight or obese were associated with being depressed. Conclusions: A positive association exists between poor dental health and depression that is independent of CRP and BMI.},

A large cohort of children was assessed for bullying involvement in childhood and then followed up in young adulthood in an assessment of health, risky or illegal behavior, wealth, and social relationships. Victims of childhood bullying, including those that bullied others (bully-victims), were at increased risk of poor health, wealth, and social-relationship outcomes in adulthood even after we controlled for family hardship and childhood psychiatric disorders. In contrast, pure bullies were not at increased risk of poor outcomes in adulthood once other family and childhood risk factors were taken into account. Being bullied is not a harmless rite of passage but throws a long shadow over affected people's lives. Interventions in childhood are likely to reduce long-term health and social costs.},

PE has received strong research support as an effective treatment for PTSD. The scientific evidence for experiential therapy is sparser, but also positive. In addition, clinical and research evidence suggest that (a) experiential processes are inherently embedded in PE, and may influence PE outcomes; and that (b) AEDP addresses several clinical and relational factors that are negative prognostic factors for PE (e.g., affect dysregulation, disorganized attachment, sense of alienation and mental defeat, dissociation, and disorders of the self). Suggestions are provided for further empirical exploration of the process and efficacy of AEDP and experientially informed PE for complex cases of PTSD.

These cues elicit conditional compensatory responses and modulate the expression of tolerance. Although there are many findings consistent with the conditioning analysis of tolerance, there also are contrary findings. The results of these experiments suggest that some of the apparently contradictory findings result because interoceptive pharmacological cues, as well as exteroceptive environmental cues, are paired with a drug effect. That is, within each administration, early drug-onset cues may become associated with the later, larger drug effect, and these pharmacological cues may overshadow simultaneously present environmental cues. We demonstrate the contribution of such intraadministration associations to tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine and to the expression of conditional compensatory hyperalgesia.},

abstract = {{\&} Prior research has shown that perceived social isolation (loneliness) motivates people to attend to and connect with others but to do so in a self-protective and paradoxically self-defeating fashion. Although recent research has shed light on the neural correlates of social perception, cooperation, empa-thy, rejection, and love, little is known about how individual differences in loneliness relate to neural responses to social and emotional stimuli. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that there are at least two neural mecha-nisms differentiating social perception in lonely and nonlonely young adults. For pleasant depictions, lonely individuals ap-pear to be less rewarded by social stimuli, as evidenced by weaker activation of the ventral striatum to pictures of peo-ple than of objects, whereas nonlonely individuals showed stronger activation of the ventral striatum to pictures of peo-ple than of objects. For unpleasant depictions, lonely indi-viduals were characterized by greater activation of the visual cortex to pictures of people than of objects, suggesting that their attention is drawn more to the distress of others, where-as nonlonely individuals showed greater activation of the right and left temporo-parietal junction to pictures of people than of objects, consistent with the notion that they are more likely to reflect spontaneously on the perspective of distressed others. {\&}},

abstract = {The von Economo neurons (VENs) are large bipolar neurons located in frontoinsular (FI) and anterior cingulate cortex in great apes and humans, but not other primates. We performed stereological counts of the VENs in FI and LA (limbic anterior, a component of anterior cingulate cortex) in great apes and in humans. The VENs are more numerous in humans than in apes, although one gorilla approached the lower end of the human range. We also examined the ontological development of the VENs in FI and LA in humans. The VENs first appear in small numbers in the 36th week post-conception, are rare at birth, and increase in number during the first 8 months after birth. There are significantly more VENs in the right hemisphere than in the left in FI and LA in postnatal brains of apes and humans. This asymmetry in VEN numbers may be related to asymmetries in the autonomic nervous system. The activity of the inferior anterior insula, which contains FI, is related to physiological changes in the body, decision-making, error recognition, and awareness. The VENs appear to be projection neurons, although their targets are unknown. We made a preliminary study of the connections of FI cortex based on diffusion tensor imaging in the brain of a gorilla. The VEN-containing regions connect to the frontal pole as well as to other parts of frontal and insular cortex, the septum, and the amygdala. It is likely that the VENs in FI are projecting to some or all of these structures and relaying information related to autonomic control, decision-making, or awareness. The VENs selectively express the bombesin peptides neuromedin B (NMB) and gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) which are also expressed in another population of closely related neurons, the fork cells. NMB and GRP signal satiety. The genes for NMB and GRP are expressed selectively in small populations of neurons in the insular cortex in mice. These populations may be related to the VEN and fork cells and may be involved in the regulation of appetite. The loss of these cells may be related to the loss of satiety signaling in patients with frontotemporal dementia who have damage to FI. The VENs and fork cells may be morphological spe-cializations of an ancient population of neurons involved in the control of appetite present in the insular cortex in all mammals. We found that the protein encoded by the gene DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia) is preferentially expressed by the VENs. DISC1 has undergone rapid evo-lutionary change in the line leading to humans, and since it suppresses dendritic branching it may be involved in the distinctive VEN morphology.},

abstract = {Rapid Prototyping (RP) technologies provide the ability to fabricate initial prototypes from various model materials. Stratasys Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a typical RP process that can fabricate prototypes out of ABS plastic. To predict the mechanical behavior of FDM parts, it is critical to understand the material properties of the raw FDM process material, and the effect that FDM build parameters have on anisotropic material properties. This paper characterizes the properties of ABS parts fabricated by the FDM 1650. Using a Design of Experiment (DOE) approach, the process parameters of FDM, such as raster orientation, air gap, bead width, color, and model temperature were examined. Tensile strengths and compressive strengths of directionally fabricated specimens were measured and compared with injection molded FDM ABS P400 material. For the FDM parts made with a 0.003 inch overlap between roads, the typical tensile strength ranged between 65 and 72 percent of the strength of injection molded ABS P400. The compressive strength ranged from 80 to 90 percent of the injection molded FDM ABS. Several build rules for designing FDM parts were formulated based on experimental results.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Recent advances in neuroscience have engendered interest in large-scale brain networks. Using a consistent database of cortico-cortical connectivity, generated from hemisphere-wide, retrograde tracing experiments in the macaque, we analyzed interareal weights and distances to reveal an important organi-zational principle of brain connectivity. Using appro-priate graph theoretical measures, we show that although very dense (66{\%}), the interareal network has strong structural specificity. Connection weights exhibit a heavy-tailed lognormal distribution span-ning five orders of magnitude and conform to a distance rule reflecting exponential decay with interareal separation. A single-parameter random graph model based on this rule predicts numerous features of the cortical network: (1) the existence of a network core and the distribution of cliques, (2) global and local binary properties, (3) global and local weight-based communication efficiencies modeled as network conductance, and (4) overall wire-length minimization. These findings underscore the impor-tance of distance and weight-based heterogeneity in cortical architecture and processing.},

abstract = {Power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability (HRV) offers reliable assessment of cardiovascular autonomic responses, providing a ‘window' onto the interaction of peripheral sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. Alterations in HRV are associated with various physiological and pathophysiological processes, and may contribute to morbidity and mortality. Previous studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) found lower resting HRV in patients compared to controls, suggesting increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic tone. This article describes the analysis of HRV at rest and after psychological stress in panic disorder (PD) patients, in an enlarged sample of PTSD patients, and in healthy control subjects. Standardized heart rate (HR) analysis was carried out in 14 PTSD patients, 11 PD patients and 25 matched controls. ECG recordings were made while subjects were resting (‘rest 1'), while recalling the trauma implicated in PTSD, or the circumstances of a severe panic attack, as appropriate (‘recall'), and again while resting (‘rest 2'). Controls were asked to recall a stressful life event during recall. While both patient groups had elevated HR and low frequency (LF) components of HRV at baseline (suggesting increased sympathetic activity), PTSD patients, unlike PD patients and controls, failed to respond to the recall stress with increases in HR and LF. HRV analysis demonstrates significant differences in autonomic regulation of PTSD and PD patients compared to each other and to control subjects. HRV analysis may augment biochemical studies of peripheral measures in these disorders.},

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to contribute to assertiveness research and assess the differences in assertiveness as it relates to gender, national culture, and ethnicity. Design/methodology/approach – The data for the study are from 231 undergraduate students majoring in business at one of four academic institutions: three in the USA and one in the Republic of Vietnam. Students completed the 30-item Rathus Assertiveness Schedule. Findings – This research suggests that individuals who are alike in level of education and status demonstrate similar levels of assertiveness, regardless of gender, national culture, or ethnicity. However, differences were seen as the data show white American males to be the most assertive, with African American females next. White females ranked third, followed by Vietnamese females, concluding with Vietnamese males. Research limitations/implications – Although the sample size is small, the intent of this research was never to have the subjects represent the general population in terms of the variables used. Instead, the authors attempted to control for gender, culture, and ethnicity variables by using a sample of college students who were similar in relation to education and social status. Future research could more fully research the findings from this study which suggest that African American women are more assertive than all other groups with the exception of white males. Originality/value – This study also gives credence to the suggestion that the global manager, in order to become more effective, needs to fully understand employee differences as represented by gender, national culture, and ethnicity.},

abstract = {Developmental psychologists have been interested in the cognitive ability of perspective-taking for a number of years due to the apparent link between perspective-taking deficits and Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Most of the research in this area has employed the concepts and techniques of the approach commonly referred to as ''Theory of Mind." The current paper is concerned with an alternative operant account of perspective-taking based on a modern behavioral approach to human language and cognition called Relational Frame Theory. According to this approach, the relational frames of I-YOU, HERE-THERE, and NOW-THEN are central to the development of complex perspective-taking. The present paper reports 3 studies that investigate the development of perspective-taking in terms of these 3 relational frames. In Study 1, 5 age groups of participants ranging from early childhood to adulthood were exposed to a protocol assessing their abilities to respond to relational perspective-taking tasks. A developmental profile was then constructed from the relative performances of the different age groups on this protocol. The findings from Study 1 overall indicated that accuracy increased as a function of age. Studies 2 and 3 were subsequently conducted as controls. Specifically, Study 2 was employed to determine whether the low rates of accuracy recorded with the youngest group of partiCipants in Study 1 was simply a function of the length of the statements contained within some of the tasks. The results from Study 2 suggested that this was not the case. In Study 3 an automated version of the protocol was employed to determine whether the high rates of accuracy recorded with the adult participants in Study 1 was a function of cueing. The results from this study similarly indicated that this was not the case. Overall, the findings from the 3 studies lend support to the Relational Frame approach to the development of perspective-taking as generalized operant behavior.},

abstract = {Learning theory provides a foundation for understanding and deriving treatment principles for impacting a spectrum of functional processes relevant to the construct of depression. While behavioral interventions have been commonplace in the cognitive behavioral tradition, most often conceptualized within a cognitive theoretical framework, recent years have seen renewed interest in more purely behavioral models. These modern learning theory accounts of depression focus on the interchange between behavior and the environment, mainly in terms of lack of reinforcement, extinction of instrumental behavior, and excesses of aversive control, and include a conceptualization of relevant cognitive and emotional variables. These positions, drawn from extensive basic and applied research, cohere with biological theories on reduced reward learning and reward responsiveness and views of depression as a heterogeneous, complex set of disorders. Treatment techniques based on learning theory, often labeled Behavioral Activation (BA) focus on activating the individual in directions that increase contact with potential reinforcers, as defined ideographically with the client. BA is considered an empirically well-established treatment that generalizes well across diverse contexts and populations. The learning theory account is discussed in terms of being a parsimonious model and ground for treatments highly suitable for large scale dissemination.},

abstract = {The treatment of addictive disorders remains based on short- and long-term strategies that employ and integrate various individual and group-based therapeutic interventions, case management, residential structure, values-based programs, cognitive behavioral therapies, pharmacological interventions, motivational techniques, and other methods. Addictive disorders are complex and associated with other comorbid conditions, and it seems unlikely that a simple and single approach will satisfy the needs of patients. This chapter is addressed to the clinician that has limited experience with the techniques to be described, and is meant as an introduction to the topic. It is important to point out that neurofeedback is used as an add-on treatment to other therapies, namely 12-step programs, and/or cognitive behavioral therapies or other types of psychotherapies or residential programs. Neurotherapy is not validated as a stand-alone therapy for addictive disorders. Secondly, it is important to point out that many persons with substance use disorders have comorbid conditions that need to be considered in designing a treatment plan that incorporates neurotherapy. These include conditions such as MTBI or ADHD, which may require separate neurofeedback treatment for those specific conditions either preceding neurofeedback treatment for addiction, or incorporated into it. There are also conditions such as affective disorders and anxiety disorders that occur commonly in substance use disorders that may respond well to neurofeedback protocols for addictive disorders. These conditions may require separate assessments during the course of therapy to determine response and the need for changing protocols or adding other treatments, i.e., medication or psychotherapy to integrate into the treatment plan.},

abstract = {Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) has been conceptualized as an index of emotion regulation abilities. Although resting RSA has been associated with both concurrent and prospective affective responses to stress, the impact of RSA reactivity on emotional responses to stress is inconsistent across studies. The type of emotional stimuli used to elicit these phasic RSA responses may influence the adaptive value of RSA reactivity. We propose that RSA reactivity to a personally relevant worry-based stressor might forecast future affective responses to stress. To evaluate whether resting RSA and RSA reactivity to worry inductions predict stress-related increases in psychological distress, an academic stress model was used to prospectively examine changes in psychological distress from the well-defined low- and high-stress periods. During the low-stress period, 76 participants completed self-report mood measures and had their RSA assessed during a resting baseline, free worry period and worry catastrophizing interview. Participants completed another mood assessment during the high-stress period. Results indicated that baseline psychological distress predicted larger decreases in RSA during the worry inductions. Lower resting RSA and greater RSA suppression to the worry inductions at baseline prospectively predicted larger increases in psychological distress from the low- to high-stress period, even after accounting for the impact of baseline distress on RSA. These results provide further evidence that RSA may represent a unique index of emotion regulation abilities in times of stress.},

abstract = {Aims: The purpose of this study was to perform a comparative investigation of metacognitive beliefs regarding pathological worry in patients with unipolar and bipolar depressive disorder. Methods: Those subjects with acute depressive episodes among patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (unipolar) or bipolar disorder on the basis of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (unipolar n = 51, bipolar n = 45), and healthy controls (n = 60), were included in the study. Participants were administered the Meta-Cognitions Questionnaire (MCQ-30) in order to determine metacognitive beliefs. The relationship between metacognitive beliefs and anxiety severity, depression severity and self-esteem in the unipolar and bipolar patients groups was then examined. Results: Scores for negative beliefs about worry concerning uncontrollability and danger and for beliefs about the need to control thoughts were higher in both the unipolar and bipolar depression groups than in the healthy controls (P {\textless} 0.05). Lack of cognitive confidence scores were higher in the bipolar group than in the healthy controls (P {\textless} 0.05). Metacognitive beliefs (to a greater extent in parameters in the bipolar group) were correlated with anxiety level, depression level and self-esteem in both patient groups. Conclusion: In addition to metacognitive beliefs known to be associated with ruminations in unipolar and bipolar depression, metacognitive beliefs can also be seen in association with worry. Worry-associated metacognitive beliefs should be the subject of focus in the identification of metacognitive beliefs in depression patients and in metacognitive therapy in these patients. {\textcopyright} 2014 Informa Healthcare.},

A review of longitudinal studies of children and adolescents with ADHD showed that the majority will have continued cognitive and functional impairments into adulthood. The thalamus likely plays a prominent role in ADHD symptomatology, based on evidence that the thalamus generates waking-state electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms along with extensive thalamic neural circuitry connections with cortical and subcortical areas. Research demonstrates a specific abnormality in the thalamic pulvinar nucleus in ADHD populations. The thalamus can also play a role in ADHD treatment, based on solid evidence that both animals and humans can learn to self-regulate EEG oscillations. Given the underarousal and sleep disturbance commonly seen in ADHD, along with data that indicate an increased dosage of ADHD medication may improve behavioral control at a cost of lowered cognitive functioning, further investigation of the role for self-regulation through EEG training is warranted.},

abstract = {{\&} Some involvement of the human amygdala in the process-ing of facial expressions has been investigated in neuroimaging studies, although the neural mechanisms underlying motivated or emotional behavior in response to facial stimuli are not yet fully understood. We investigated, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and healthy volunteers, how the amygdala interacts with other cortical regions while subjects are judging the sex of faces with negative, positive, or neutral emotion. The data were analyzed by a subtractive method, then, to clarify possible interaction among regions within the brain, several kinds of analysis (i.e., a correlation analysis, a psychophysiological interaction analysis and a structural equation modeling) were performed. Overall, significant activation was observed in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, medial temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, and the right parietal lobe during the task. The results of subtraction between the conditions showed that the left amygdala, right orbitofrontal cortex, and temporal cortices were predominantly involved in the processing of the negative expressions. The right angular gyrus was involved in the processing of the positive expressions when the negative condition was subtracted from the positive condition. The correlation analysis showed that activity in the left amygdala positively correlated with activity in the left prefrontal cortex under the negative minus neutral subtraction condition. The psychophysiological interaction revealed that the neural responses in the left amygdala and the right prefrontal cortex underwent the condition-specific changes between the negative and positive face conditions. The right amygdaloid activity also had an interactive effect with activity in the right hippocampus and middle temporal gyrus. These results may suggest that the left and right amygdalae play a differential role in effective processing of facial expressions in collaboration with other cortical or subcortical regions, with the left being related with the bilateral prefrontal cortex, and the right with the right temporal lobe. {\&}},

The purposes of this review article of third wave treatment RCTs were: (1) to describe and review them methodologically, (2) to meta-analytically assess their efficacy, and (3) to evaluate if they currently fulfil the criteria for empirically supported treatments. There are 13 RCTs both in ACT and DBT, 1 in CBASP, 2 in IBCT, and none in FAP. The conclusions that can be drawn are that the third wave treatment RCTs used a research methodology that was significantly less stringent than CBT studies; that the mean effect size was moderate for both ACT and DBT, and that none of the third wave therapies fulfilled the criteria for empirically supported treatments. The article ends with suggestions on how to improve future RCTs to increase the possibility of them becoming empirically supported treatments.},

Subsequently subjects were randomized to three groups: a moderated self-help group, which served as a control group, and two treatment groups, where either relaxation techniques or imagery rescripting were applied. Methods Students suffering from test anxiety were recruited at two German universities (n=180). The randomized controlled design comprised three groups which received test anxiety treatment in weekly three-hour sessions over a period of five weeks. Treatment outcome was assessed with a test anxiety questionnaire, which was administered before and after treatment, as well as in a six-month follow-up. Results A repeated-measures ANOVA for participants with complete data (n=59) revealed a significant reduction of test anxiety from baseline to six-month follow-up in all three treatment groups (p{\textless}.001). Limitations Participants were included if they had a clinical diagnosis of test anxiety. The sample may therefore represent only more severe forms of text anxiety. Moreover, the sample size in this study was small, the numbers of participants per group differed, and treatment results were based on self-report. Due to the length of the treatment, an implementation of the group treatments used in this study might not be feasible in all settings. Conclusions Group treatments constitute an effective method of treating test anxiety, e.g. in university settings. Imagery rescripting may particularly contribute to treatment efficacy.},

abstract = {Inner speech—also known as covert speech or verbal thinking— has been implicated in theories of cognitive development, speech monitoring, executive function, and psychopathology. Despite a growing body of knowledge on its phenomenology, development, and function, approaches to the scientific study of inner speech have remained diffuse and largely unintegrated. This review examines prominent theoretical approaches to inner speech and methodological challenges in its study, before reviewing current evidence on inner speech in children and adults from both typical and atypical populations. We conclude by considering prospects for an integrated cognitive science of inner speech, and present a multicomponent model of the phenomenon informed by developmental, cognitive, and psycholinguistic considerations. Despite its variability among individuals and across the life span, inner speech appears to perform significant functions in human cognition, which in some cases reflect its developmental origins and its sharing of resources with other cognitive processes. When people reflect upon their own inner experience, they often report that it has a verbal quality (Baars, 2003). Also referred to as verbal thinking, inner speaking, covert self-talk, internal mono-logue, and internal dialogue, inner speech has been proposed to have an important role in the self-regulation of cognition and behavior in both childhood and adulthood, with implications for inner speech dysfunction in psychiatric conditions and develop-mental disorders involving atypical language skills or deficits in self-regulation (Diaz {\&} Berk, 1992; Fernyhough, 1996; Vygotsky, 1934/1987). Despite its apparent importance for human cognition, inner speech has received relatively little attention from psychol-ogists and cognitive neuroscientists, partly due to methodological problems involved in its study. Nevertheless, a large body of empirical work has arisen relating to inner speech, albeit in rather disparate research areas, and it plays an increasingly prominent The aim of the present article is to review the existing empirical work on inner speech and provide a theoretical integration of well-established and more recent research findings. First, we sum-marize the key theoretical positions that have been advanced relating to the development, cognitive functions, and phenomenol-ogy of inner speech. We then consider methodological issues that attend the study of inner speech. Next, we consider how inner speech emerges in childhood. In the fourth section, we consider the phenomenology of inner speech in adulthood along with its cog-nitive functions. We then review what is known about inner speech in atypical populations before considering neuropsychological ev-idence relevant to theorizing about its functional significance. Finally, we consider prospects for an integrated cognitive science of inner speech, combining developmental, cognitive, psycholin-guistic, and neuropsychological evidence to provide a multicom-ponent model of the phenomenon. Inner speech can be defined as the subjective experience of language in the absence of overt and audible articulation. This definition is necessarily simplistic: as the following will demon-strate, experiences of this kind vary widely in their phenomenol-ogy, their addressivity to others, their relation to the self, and their similarity to external speech. Inner speech, on these terms, incor-porates but does not reduce to phenomena such as subvocal re-hearsal (the use of phonological codes for the maintenance of information in working memory). The concept is also sometimes used interchangeably with thinking, to the extent that a close focus on the phenomenological, developmental, and cognitive features of inner speech necessitates a certain amount of redefinition of that term. In what follows, we will avoid talking about thinking in favour of mental processes that can be more tightly specified.},

abstract = {Citation: Colder B (2015) The basal ganglia select the expected sensory input used for predictive coding. While considerable evidence supports the notion that lower-level interpretation of incoming sensory information is guided by top-down sensory expectations, less is known about the source of the sensory expectations or the mechanisms by which they are spread. Predictive coding theory proposes that sensory expectations flow down from higher-level association areas to lower-level sensory cortex. A separate theory of the role of prediction in cognition describes " emulations " as linked representations of potential actions and their associated expected sensation that are hypothesized to play an important role in many aspects of cognition. The expected sensations in active emulations are proposed to be the top-down expectation used in predictive coding. Representations of the potential action and expected sensation in emulations are claimed to be instantiated in distributed cortical networks. Combining predictive coding with emulations thus provides a theoretical link between the top-down expectations that guide sensory expectations and the cortical networks representing potential actions. Now moving to theories of action selection, the basal ganglia has long been proposed to select between potential actions by reducing inhibition to the cortical network instantiating the desired action plan. Integration of these isolated theories leads to the novel hypothesis that reduction in inhibition from the basal ganglia selects not just action plans, but entire emulations, including the sensory input expected to result from the action. Basal ganglia disinhibition is hypothesized to both initiate an action and also allow propagation of the action's associated sensory expectation down towards primary sensory cortex. This is a novel proposal for the role of the basal ganglia in biasing perception by selecting the expected sensation, and initiating the top-down transmission of those expectations in predictive coding.},

abstract = {The teaching of psychodynamic psychotherapy is a critical component of psychiatric residency training programs. The authors argue that encourag-ing our residents to become active while providing psychodynamic psycho-therapy is a skill that can be taught. By helping residents to understand how to actively help patients focus on their internal world, identify and work with the defenses, and develop and maintain a treatment alliance, psychodynamic educators can enable psychiatric residents to feel far more competent when working in this paradigm. Such a stance inevitably leads to greater excitement and enjoyment for trainees, as well as better outcomes for patients. A middle-aged man enters his therapy session with a deep sigh and palpable sense of resignation. He sits silently and looks imploringly at his therapist, who also remains silent. Finally, the patient begins to discuss his ongoing depression, seemingly intractable problems with his wife, and stress in the workplace. He asks his therapist what he can do to improve his life. Not wanting to provide advice, the therapist (who is also a PGY-3 resident) throws the question back to the patient. Throughout the session, the therapist maintains a passive stance, mir-roring the slumped posture and slow, hesitant speech demonstrated by her patient. Both sink into a kind of quiet despair. Although the therapist wants to help and is well versed in the theory behind psycho-dynamic psychotherapy, she has not been trained to intervene actively and effectively in a manner consistent with that theory. She is not alone in not knowing what to say or do. Our students frequently feel that good psychodynamic psychotherapists say very little to patients. We, as psychodynamic educators, must do a better job of teaching residents that they can, and should, make active interventions with their patients.},

abstract = {Being able to replicate scientific findings is crucial for scientific progress 1-15. We replicate 21 systematically selected experimental studies in the social sciences published in Nature and Science between 2010 and 2015 16-36. The replications follow analysis plans reviewed by the original authors and pre-registered prior to the replications. The replications are high powered, with sample sizes on average about five times higher than in the original studies. We find a significant effect in the same direction as the original study for 13 (62{\%}) studies , and the effect size of the replications is on average about 50{\%} of the original effect size. Replicability varies between 12 (57{\%}) and 14 (67{\%}) studies for complementary replicability indicators. Consistent with these results, the estimated true-positive rate is 67{\%} in a Bayesian analysis. The relative effect size of true positives is estimated to be 71{\%}, suggesting that both false positives and inflated effect sizes of true positives contribute to imperfect reproducibility. Furthermore, we find that peer beliefs of replicability are strongly related to replica-bility, suggesting that the research community could predict which results would replicate and that failures to replicate were not the result of chance alone. To what extent can we trust scientific findings? The answer to this question is of fundamental importance 1-3 , and the reproduc-ibility of published studies has been questioned in many fields 4-10. Until recently, systematic evidence has been scarce 11-15. The Reproducibility Project: Psychology (RPP) 12 put the question of scientific reproducibility at the forefront of scientific debate 37-39. The RPP replicated 100 original studies in psychology and found a significant effect in the same direction as the original studies for 36{\%} of the 97 studies reporting 'positive findings' 12. The RPP was followed by the Experimental Economics Replication Project (EERP), which replicated 18 laboratory experiments in economics and found a significant effect in the same direction as the original studies for 61{\%} of replications 13. Both the RPP and the EERP had high statistical power to detect the effect sizes observed in the original studies. However, the effect sizes of published studies may be inflated even for true-positive findings owing to publication or reporting biases 40-42. As a consequence, if replications were well powered to detect effect sizes smaller than those observed in the original studies , replication rates might be higher than those estimated in the RPP and the EERP. We provide evidence about the replicability of experimental studies in the social sciences published in the two most prestigious general science journals, Nature and Science (the Social Sciences Replication Project (SSRP)). Articles published in these journals are considered exciting, innovative and important. We include all experimental studies published between 2010 and 2015 that (1) test for an experimental treatment effect between or within subjects, (2) test at least one clear hypothesis with a statistically significant finding, and (3) were performed on students or other accessible subject pools. Twenty-one studies were identified to meet these criteria. We used the following three criteria in descending order to determine which treatment effect to replicate within each of these 21 papers: (a) select the first study reporting a significant treatment effect for papers reporting more than one study, (b) from that study, select the statistically significant result identified in the original study as the most important result among all within-and between-subject treatment comparisons, and (c) if there was more than one equally central result, randomly select one of them for replication.},

abstract = {Objective: The efficacy of cognitive therapy (CT) for depression has been well established. Measures of the adequacy of therapists' delivery of treatment are critical to facilitating therapist training and treatment dissemination. While some studies have shown an association between CT competence and outcome, researchers have yet to address whether competence ratings predict subsequent outcomes. Method: In a sample of 60 moderately to severely depressed outpatients from a clinical trial, we examined competence ratings (using the Cognitive Therapy Scale) as a predictor of subsequent symptom change. Results: Competence ratings predicted session-to-session symptom change early in treatment. In analyses focused on prediction of symptom change following 4 early sessions through the end of 16 weeks of treatment, competence was shown to be a significant predictor of evaluator-rated end-of-treatment depressive symptom severity and was predictive of self-reported symptom severity at the level of a nonsignificant trend. To investigate whether competence is more important to clients with specific complicating features, we examined 4 patient characteristics as potential moderators of the competence-outcome relation. Competence was more highly related to subsequent outcome for patients with higher anxiety, an earlier age of onset, and (at a trend level) patients with a chronic form of depression (chronic depression or dysthymia) than for those patients without these characteristics. Competence ratings were not more predictive of subsequent outcomes among patients who met (vs. those who did not meet) criteria for a personality disorder (i.e., among personality disorders represented in the clinical trial). Conclusions: These findings provide support for the potential utility of CT competence ratings in applied settings.},

MBSR is believed to alter emotional responding by modifying cognitive-affective processes. Given that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by emotional and attentional biases as well as distorted negative self-beliefs, we examined MBSR-related changes in the brain-behavior indices of emotional reactivity and regulation of negative self-beliefs in patients with SAD. Sixteen patients underwent functional MRI while reacting to negative self-beliefs and while regulating negative emotions using 2 types of attention deployment emotion regulation-breath-focused attention and distraction-focused attention. Post-MBSR, 14 patients completed neuroimaging assessments. Compared with baseline, MBSR completers showed improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms and self-esteem. During the breath-focused attention task (but not the distraction-focused attention task), they also showed (a) decreased negative emotion experience, (b) reduced amygdala activity, and (c) increased activity in brain regions implicated in attentional deployment. MBSR training in patients with SAD may reduce emotional reactivity while enhancing emotion regulation. These changes might facilitate reduction in SAD-related avoidance behaviors, clinical symptoms, and automatic emotional reactivity to negative self-beliefs in adults with SAD.},

Chalmers posed this question and answered it provocatively: cognitive processes "ain't all in the head." The environment has an active role in driving cognition; cognition is sometimes made up of neural, bodily, and environmental processes. Their argument excited a vigorous debate among philosophers, both supporters and detractors. This volume brings together for the first time the best responses to Clark and Chalmers's bold proposal. These responses, together with the original paper by Clark and Chalmers, offer a valuable overview of the latest research on the extended mind thesis. The contributors first discuss (and answer) objections raised to Clark and Chalmers's thesis. Clark himself responds to critics in an essay that uses the movie Memento's amnesia-aiding notes and tattoos to illustrate the workings of the extended mind. Contributors then consider the different directions in which the extended mind project might be taken, including the need for an approach that focuses on cognitive activity and practice.},

The paper has two objectives: first, to provide an explicit statement of the theory; and second, to introduce the features of a polyvagal perspective. The polyvagal perspective emphasizes how an understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms and phylogenetic shifts in neural regulation leads to different questions, paradigms, explanations, and conclusions regarding autonomic function in biobehavioral processes than peripheral models. Foremost, the polyvagal perspective emphasizes the importance of phylogenetic changes in the neural structures regulating the autonomic nervous system and how these phylogenetic shifts provide insights into the adaptive function and the neural regulation of the two vagal systems.},

Nevertheless, much remains to be learned about predictors of treatment response and mechanisms of behavioral change. In this study, the authors combine data from 6 randomized clinical trials and 514 children, ages 3.0-8.5 years, to evaluate moderators, mediators, and predictors of outcome. Among other findings, latent growth curve models of mother-report and observational measures of child externalizing behaviors suggested that marital adjustment, maternal depression, paternal substance abuse, and child comorbid anxiety/depression each moderated treatment response. Moreover, critical, harsh, and ineffective parenting both predicted and mediated outcome, with the most favorable responses observed when parents scored relatively low on each construct at intake yet improved during treatment. Implications for treatment nonresponders are discussed.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t The nascent field of 'Nutritional Psychiatry' offers much promise for addressing the large disease burden associ-ated with mental disorders. A consistent evidence base from the observational literature confirms that the quality of individuals' diets is related to their risk for common mental disorders, such as depression. This is the case across countries and age groups. Moreover, new intervention studies implementing dietary changes suggest promise for the prevention and treatment of depression. Concurrently, data point to the utility of selected nutraceuticals as adjunctive treatments for mental disorders and as monotherapies for conditions such as ADHD. Finally, new studies focused on understanding the biological pathways that mediate the observed rela-tionships between diet, nutrition and mental health are pointing to the immune system, oxidative biology, brain plasticity and the microbiome-gut-brain axis as key targets for nutritional interventions. On the other hand, the field is currently limited by a lack of data and methodological issues such as heterogeneity, residual confounding, measurement error, and challenges in measuring and ensuring dietary adherence in intervention studies. Key challenges for the field are to now: replicate, refine and scale up promising clinical and population level dietary strategies; identify a clear set of biological pathways and targets that mediate the identified associ-ations; conduct scientifically rigorous nutraceutical and 'psychobiotic' interventions that also examine predictors of treatment response; conduct observational and experimental studies in psychosis focused on dietary and re-lated risk factors and treatments; and continue to advocate for policy change to improve the food environment at the population level.},

In a series of three experiments involving a total of 168 college students (mean age 23 years), half of the participants were required to restrain their impulses to eat a tempting snack (Experiment 1) or to constrain their emotional and physical reactions to a boring film (Experiments 2 and 3), whereas the other half was not. Thereafter all participants were insulted by the experimenter, who criticized their performance in a creativity task. Aggressive responses toward the experimenter were then measured by subjects' ratings on a three-item feedback form, the results of which purportedly influenced future funding. Results showed that subjects in the experimental group, whose ego strength had been depleted by acts of self-control, responded more aggressively to the insult than controls. The findings are interpreted in support of the hypothesis that the ability to inhibit aggressive behavior is a limited resource which can be depleted by acts of self-regulation. (K.Si. - ZPID)},

Core EFs are inhibition [response inhibition (self-control—resisting temptations and resisting acting impulsively) and interference control (selective attention and cognitive inhibition)], working memory, and cognitive flexibility (including creatively thinking “outside the box,” seeing anything from different perspectives, and quickly and flexibly adapting to changed circumstances). The developmental progression and representative measures of each are discussed. Controversies are addressed (e.g., the relation between EFs and fluid intelligence, self-regulation, executive attention, and effortful control, and the relation between working memory and inhibition and attention). The importance of social, emotional, and physical health for cognitive health is discussed because stress, lack of sleep, loneliness, or lack of exercise each impair EFs. That EFs are trainable and can be improved with practice is addressed, including diverse methods tried thus far.},

There is also evidence of significant improvements in measures of intelligence, academic performance, and behavior. Even as further research is awaited meeting stringent criteria regarding random assignment of subjects, and more follow-up studies regarding maintaining gains, neurofeedback (NFB) has established itself as a key component in the treatment of ADHD that adds to positive outcomes. It is not easy work and it needs to be done carefully, always keeping in mind that there should be evidence of learning, as measured by EEG parameters as well as transfer of the self-regulation skills to everyday life. Neurofeedback fits into the twenty-first century Zeitgeist concerning health maintenance and self-regulation; that is, skills, not just pills. The real power of NFB, and the reason it should become the preferred intervention for ADHD, is that it empowers the child, or adult for that matter, to achieve changes through their own efforts, and thus gain the means and motivation to realize their full potential.},

abstract = {Intuition suggests that perception follows sensation and therefore bodily feelings originate in the body. However, recent evidence goes against this logic: interoceptive experience may largely reflect limbic predictions about the expected state of the body that are constrained by ascending visceral sensations. In this Opinion article, we introduce the Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding model, which integrates an anatomical model of corticocortical connections with Bayesian active inference principles, to propose that agranular visceromotor cortices contribute to interoception by issuing interoceptive predictions. We then discuss how disruptions in interoceptive predictions could function as a common vulnerability for mental and physical illness. For many decades, neuroscientists understood the brain as a 'stimulus–response' organ, consisting of individual neurons that lie dormant until stimulated. In this traditional model, learning and experience merely modulate neural activity that is driven by sensory events in the world. In recent years, scientists have come to realize that the brain probably does not work this way. Instead, research and theory are converging on the idea of the brain as an active inference generator that functions according to a Bayesian approach to probability: sensory inputs constrain estimates of prior probability (from past experience) to create the posterior probabilities that serve as beliefs about the causes of such inputs in the present 1,2 .},

Bandura (1997) proposed four sources of self-efficacy: mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasion, and physiological and affective states. This study introduces a first instrument to assess the four sources for TSE in line with Bandura's conception. Gathering evidence of convergent validity, the contribution that each source made to the development of TSE during a practicum at a school was explored for two samples of German preservice teachers. The first sample (N = 359) were beginning preservice teachers who completed an observation practicum. The second sample (N = 395) were advanced preservice teachers who completed a teaching practicum. The source measure showed good reliability, construct validity, and convergent validity. Latent true change modeling was applied to explore how the sources predicted changes in TSE. Three different models were compared. As expected, results showed that TSE changes in both groups were significantly predicted by mastery experiences, with a stronger relationship in the advanced group. Further, the results indicated that mastery experiences were largely informed by the other three sources to varying degrees depending on the type of practicum. Implications for the practice of teacher education are discussed in light of the results.},

Five general categories of healthy workplace prac- tices were identified in the literature: work-life balance, employee growth and development, health and safety, recognition, and employee involvement. Previous research also suggests that the link between these practices and em- ployee and organizational outcomes is contin- gent on the effectiveness of communication within the organization and the alignment of workplace practices with the organizational context. Finally, a discussion of some limita- tions of previous research and recommenda- tions for future work in the area of healthy workplace practices are provided.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Background: Many psychological disorders are associated with comorbid physical illness. There are less data on dental disease in common psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety in spite of risk factors in this population of diet, lifestyle or antidepressant-induced dry mouth. Methods: We undertook a systematic search for studies of the oral health of people with common psychological disorders including depression, anxiety and dental phobia. We searched MEDLINE, Psy-cInfo, EMBASE and article bibliographies. Results were compared with the general population. Outcomes included partial or total tooth-loss, periodontal disease, and dental decay measured through standar-dized measures such as the mean number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) or surfaces (DMFS). Results: There were 19 papers on depression and/or anxiety, and seven on dental phobia/anxiety (total n¼ 26). These covered 334,503 subjects. All the psychiatric diagnoses were associated with increased dental decay on both DMFT and DMFS scores, as well as greater tooth loss (OR ¼1.22; 95{\%}CI ¼1.14–1.30). There was no association with periodontal disease, except for panic disorder. Limitations: Cross-sectional design of included studies, heterogeneity in some results, insufficient studies to test for publication bias. Conclusion: The increased focus on the physical health of psychiatric patients should encompass oral health including closer collaboration between dental and medical practitioners. Possible interventions include oral health assessment using standard checklists that can be completed by non-dental personnel, help with oral hygiene, management of iatrogenic dry mouth, and early dental referral. Mental health clinicians should also be aware of the oral consequences of inappropriate diet and psychotropic medi-cation.},

An evidence-base evaluation showed that ACT is not yet well-established for any disorder. It is probably efficacious for chronic pain and tinnitus, possibly efficacious for depression, psychotic symptoms, OCD, mixed anxiety, drug abuse, and stress at work, and experimental for the remaining disorders.},

abstract = {Love is a wondrous state, deep, tender, and re-warding. Because of its intimate and personal na-ture it is regarded by some as an improper topic for experimental research. But, whatever our per-sonal feelings may be, our assigned mission as psy-chologists is to analyze all facets of human and animal behavior into their component variables. So far as love or affection is concerned, psycholo-gists have failed in this mission. The little we know about love does not transcend simple obser-vation, and the little we write about it has been written better by poets and novelists. But of greater concern is the fact that psychologists tend to give progressively less attention to a motive which pervades our entire lives. Psychologists, at least psychologists who write textbooks, not only show no interest in the origin and development of love or affection, but they seem to be unaware of its very existence. The apparent repression of love by modern psy-chologists stands in sharp contrast with the atti-tude taken by many famous and normal people. The word "love" has the highest reference fre-quency of any word cited in Bartlett's book of Familiar Quotations. It would appear that this emotion has long had a vast interest and fascina-tion for human beings, regardless of the attitude taken by psychologists; but the quotations cited, even by famous and normal people, have a mun-dane redundancy. These authors and authorities have stolen love from the child and infant and made it the exclusive property of the adolescent and adult. Thoughtful men, and probably all women, have speculated on the nature of love.

A cue-utilization approach to judgments of learning (JOLs) is outlined, distinguishing 3 types of cues for JOLs: intrinsic, extrinsic, and mnemonic. In 4 experiments using paired-associates learning, item difficulty (intrinsic) exerted similar effects of JOLs and recall. In contrast, the extrinsic factors of list repetition, item repetition within a list, and stimulus duration affected JOLs less strongly than recall, supporting the proposition that extrinsic factors are discounted in making JOLs. Although practice impaired calibration, increasing underconfidence, it did improve resolution (i.e., the recall–JOL correlation). This improvement was seen to reflect a shift in the basis of JOLs with practice, from reliance on intrinsic factors, towards greater reliance on mnemonic-based heuristics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Psychological Association. The rate of teamwork and collaboration within the workforce has burgeoned over the years, and the use of teams is projected to continue increasing. With the rise of teamwork comes the need for interventions designed to enhance teamwork effectiveness. Successful teams produce desired outcomes; however, it is critical that team members demonstrate effective processes to achieve these outcomes. Team development interventions (TDIs) increase effective team competencies and processes, thereby leading to improvements in proximal and distal outcomes. The effectiveness of TDIs is evident across domains (e.g., education, health care, military, aviation), and they are applicable in a wide range of settings. To stimulate the adoption and effective use of TDIs, the current article provides a review of four types of evidence-based TDIs including team training, leadership training, team building, and team debriefing. In doing so, we aim to provide psychologists with an understanding of the scientific principles underlying TDIs and their impact on team dynamics. Moreover, we provide evidence-based recommendations regarding how to increase the effectiveness of TDIs as well as a discussion on future research needed within this domain.},

abstract = {This chapter briefly reviews definitions of anxiety and anxiety disorders, identifies specific EEG and QEEG patterns which in clinical practice and/or research have been found to be correlates of some anxiety disorders, and cites neurofeedback protocols for treating anxiety as suggested by experienced clinicians and/or by research. Augmenting procedures such as breathwork, muscle relaxation, heart rate variability training, AVE, EMDR, cognitive behavioral therapy, and other psychotherapy forms are given only a brief mention. That anxiety states are complex disorders is obvious, not only because of the multiple patterns of differences displayed by QEEG, fMRI and SPECT, but also due to the disparate manifest emotional/behavioral symptoms that may or may not correlate with the above physiological measurements. Despite the diversity of EEG anxiety patterns, clusters of them often occur, constituting an emotional/behavioral clinical picture such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are some QEEG patterns found by research, and/or through clinical experience, to be associated with general or specific anxiety disorders, and there are some neurofeedback training protocols rather consistently cited by expert clinicians as efficacious for treatment of these disorders. For example, given a fairly clear anxiety-related behavioral state, or given one or more specific EEG/QEEG pattern, attention to increasing posterior alpha power and/or decreasing beta power in frontal or temporal sites is a commonly reported approach. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Executive Overview Extensive research on leadership behavior during the past half century has yielded many different behavior taxonomies and a lack of clear results about effective behaviors. One purpose of this article is to describe what has been learned about effective leadership behavior in organizations. A hierarchical taxonomy with four meta-categories and 15 specific component behaviors was used to interpret results in the diverse and extensive literature and to identify conditions that influence the effectiveness of these behaviors. Limita- tions and potential extensions of the hierarchical taxonomy are discussed, and suggestions for improving research on effective leadership behavior are provided.},

abstract = {Fear memory is a motivational system essential for organisms survival having a central role in organization of defensive behaviors to threat. In the last years there has been a growing interest on conditioned fear memory reconsolidation and extinction, two specific phases of memorization process, both induced by memory retrieval. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these two mnemonic processes may allow to work out therapeutic interventions for treatment of human fear and anxiety disorders, such as specific phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. Based on the use of one-trial conditioning paradigms, which allow to follow the evolution of a mnemonic trace in its various phases, the present paper has attempted to reorganize the current literature relative to the rodents highlighting both the role of several brain structures in conditioned fear memory reconsolidation and extinction and the selective cellular processes involved. A crucial role seems to be play by medial prefrontal cortex, in particular by prelimbic and infralimbic cortices, and by distinct connections between them and the amygdala, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.},

abstract = {Is it possible to understand the intentions of other people by simply observing their actions? Many believe that this ability is made possible by the brain's mirror neuron system through its direct link between action and observation. However, precisely how intentions can be inferred through action observation has provoked much debate. Here we suggest that the function of the mirror system can be understood within a predictive coding framework that appeals to the statistical approach known as empirical Bayes. Within this scheme the most likely cause of an observed action can be inferred by minimizing the prediction error at all levels of the cortical hierarchy that are engaged during action observation. This account identifies a precise role for the mirror system in our ability to infer intentions from actions and provides the outline of the underlying computational mechanisms.},

AIMS; To evaluate the reliability and validity of the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). METHOD Data from two studies were analysed. Reliability analyses included internal scale consistency, test-retest and parallel forms. Convergent and criterion validities were examined with respect to disorder severity. RESULTS Cronbach's alpha measure of internal scale consistency ranged from 0.70 to 0.94. Test-retest correlation was 0.73. Interactive voice response administrations of the WSAS gave correlations of 0.81 and 0.86 with clinician interviews. Correlations of WSAS with severity of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms were 0.76 and 0.61, respectively. The scores were sensitive to patient differences in disorder severity and treatment-related change. CONCLUSIONS The WSAS is a simple, reliable and valid measure of impaired functioning. It is a sensitive and useful outcome measure offering the potential for readily interpretable comparisons across studies and disorders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metacognitive therapy (MCT) is a relatively new approach to treating mental disorders. The aim of the current meta-analysis was to examine the efficacy of MCT in patients with mental disorders.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: A comprehensive literature search revealed 16 published as well as unpublished studies on the efficacy of MCT, of which nine were controlled trials. These studies report on 384 participants suffering from anxiety or depression. Treatment efficacy was examined using a random effects model.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: On primary outcome measures the aggregate within-group pre- to posttreatment and pretreatment to follow-up effect sizes for MCT were large (Hedges' g = 2.00 and 1.65, respectively). Within-group pre- to posttreatment changes in metacognitions were also large (Hedges' g = 1.18) and maintained at follow-up (Hedges' g = 1.31). Across the controlled trials, MCT was significantly more effective than both waitlist control groups (between-group Hedges' g = 1.81) as well as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT; between-group Hedges' g = 0.97).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that MCT is effective in treating disorders of anxiety and depression and is superior compared to waitlist control groups and CBT, although the latter finding should be interpreted with caution. The implications of these findings are limited by small sample sizes and few active control conditions. Future studies should include larger sample sizes and also include comparisons of MCT with other empirically supported therapies.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t The mental states of other people are components of the external world that modulate the activity of our sensory epithelia. Recent probabilistic frameworks that cast perception as unconscious inference on the external causes of sensory input can thus be expanded to enfold the brain's representation of others' mental states. This paper examines this subject in the context of the debate concerning the extent to which we have perceptual awareness of other minds. In particular, we suggest that the notion of perceptual presence helps to refine this debate: are others' mental states experienced as veridical qualities of the perceptual world around us? This experiential aspect of social cognition may be central to conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, where representations of others' mental states seem to be selectively compromised. Importantly, recent work ties perceptual pres-ence to the counterfactual predictions of hierarchical generative models that are suggested to perform unconscious inference in the brain. This enables a characterisation of mental state representations in terms of their associated counterfactual predictions, allowing a distinction between spontaneous and explicit forms of mentalising within the framework of predictive processing. This leads to a hypothesis that social cognition in autism spectrum disorder is characterised by a diminished set of counterfactual predictions and the reduced perceptual presence of others' mental states.},

The intent is to help practitioners provide services that meet the expected practice standards (duty of care) that clients, other health care professionals, and third-party payers expect, while simultaneously helping practitioners avoid unnecessary risks. At the outset it must be stated that from an ethical, legal and professional viewpoint, neurofeedback is more similar to, than different from, other biofeedback applications. Many ethical issues encountered by neurofeedback practitioners are the same as those encountered by practitioners using other biofeedback modalities, for example client confidentiality, informed consent, need for clinical and research support, and fees and billing issues. In addition, conservative groups like state licensing boards are accepting more and more neurofeedback applications as being traditional interventions. As always, newer, non-traditional biofeedback procedures require practitioners to take extra precautions, e.g., during the informed consent process, to avoid unnecessary risks, and to maintain good working relationships with their clients, other practitioners, and third-party payers. The chapter discusses a variety of issues associated with practicing neurofeedback. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

I propose that action mirroring is generated by action recon- struction via top-down emulation from action interpretation produced outside the motor system. Such action mirroring does not follow but anticipates ongoing actions and enables, beyond predictive tracking, action coordination with others. I argue that the available empirical evidence is more compatible with this alternative model than with the direct-matching account.},

abstract = {The journal article, the publication of scientific results of a study, is a beautifully constructed document with several well-known key components, the so-called IMRaD style of introduction, methods/ materials, results, and discussion. While most scien-tists are cognizant of these components and generally are able to write them reasonably well, the abstract of the article is often a mystery. What is the purpose of the abstract? What should it contain? How does the abstract relate to the full manuscript? How can a 250-word limit do justice to all the data collected? Can the skills needed for writing the abstract of a manuscript be learned? I hope to show that manu-script abstracts indeed are not abstract (ie, free form), but rather that they abstract (ie, pull out) necessary information and compel the reader into the full article. Main Points to Consider Format Before starting the writing process, the wise au-thor will check the instructions-to-authors section of the journal on its Web page for the most current information. CHEST requires scientific manuscripts to contain a structured abstract with a maximum of 250 words (fewer are fine) with four subcategories: background; methods; results; and conclusions. The abstract for a manuscript often is, and probably should be, the last item to be written, since it summarizes the entire study. • Background: generally, this section consists of one or two sentences that briefly set the stage for your research question, followed by a clear statement of the question or hypothesis. If no research question is posed, the abstract is meaningless, providing no anchor for understanding the methods or the results. The background section is written in the present tense. • Materials and Methods: this section describes the population studied, the techniques and equipment used, the drugs or other agents administered, and the statistical methods used. Note that CHEST has specific instructions in that the number of obser-vations (ie, the number of patients or animals) must be provided in the abstract. This section is written in the past tense. • Results: This section describes the most important findings in the same order as the methods that produced the data. It is important that each result has a method and that each method has a result, even if the result was not one that you expected or wanted. This section is written in the past tense. • Conclusions: This section summarizes the study findings and may include a sentence that describes or speculates on the significance of the findings. This section is generally written in the present tense.},

abstract = {: Therapists' emotional responses to substance abuse patients have long been hypothesized to impact on treatment, but have rarely been studied. This article reports results for a new scale developed for this purpose, Ratings of Emotional Attitudes to Clients by Treaters (REACT). The REACT was administered to 52 therapists and 140 cocaine-dependent outpatients, at sessions 2, 5, and 24 of psychotherapy. It was found to have high internal consistency at each time point, moderately high convergent validity with therapists' (but not patients') therapeutic alliance ratings, and a factor structure that appeared to meaningfully derive four factors: "therapist in conflict with self," "therapist focused on own needs," "positive connection," and "therapist in conflict with the patient." Therapists' emotional responses were found to become more negative over the course of treatment, and, when compared by theoretical orientation, were found more positive for 12-step drug counselors than for cognitive or supportive-expressive therapists., copy; 1995 American Psychological Association},

abstract = {The effectiveness of a method for reducing the incidence of chemotherapy-induced learned food aversions was examined. Candy (coconut or rootbeer Lifesavers) was used as a scapegoat and given between the consumption of a meal and the administration of chemotherapy to determine whether this would lead to a greater willingness to consume items in that meal at a future test. This procedure produced evidence that the scapegoat had a significant protective effect: children were twice as likely to eat some portion of their test meal at the time of assessment if they had received the scapegoat at conditioning than when there was no intervention. Thus, the consumption of strongly flavored candies before chemotherapy appears to be a simple and effective way to reduce the impact of chemotherapy on preference for normal menu items.},

Language's evolutionary analysis is complicated because it has no equivalent in any nonhuman species. There is also no consensus regarding the essential nature of the language ‘‘phenotype.'' According to the ‘‘Strong Minimalist Thesis,'' the key distinguishing feature of language (and what evolutionary theory must explain) is hierarchical syntactic structure. The faculty of language is likely to have emerged quite recently in evolutionary terms, some 70,000–100,000 years ago, and does not seem to have undergone modification since then, though individual languages do of course change over time, operating within this basic framework. The recent emergence of language and its stability are both consistent with the Strong Minimalist Thesis, which has at its core a single repeatable operation that takes exactly two syntactic elements a and b and assembles them to form the set {\{}a, b{\}}.},

First, alpha always has a value, which cannot be equal to the test score's reliability given the interitem covariance matrix and the usual assumptions about measurement error. Second, in practice, alpha is used more often as a measure of the test's internal consistency than as an estimate of reliability. However, it can be shown easily that alpha is unrelated to the internal structure of the test. It is further discussed that statistics based on a single test administration do not convey much information about the accuracy of individuals' test performance.

The first three sins involve different types of forgetting, the next three refer to different types of distortions, and the final sin concerns intrusive recollections that are difficult to forget. Evidence is reviewed concerning each of the 7 sins from relevant sectors of psychology (cognitive, social, and clinical) and from cognitive neuroscience studies that include patients with focal brain damage or make use of recently developed neuroimaging techniques. Although the 7 sins may appear to reflect flaws in system design, it is argued instead that they are by-products of otherwise adaptive features of memory. Question:},

One of the manifestations of a basic metarepresentational ca-pacity is a 'theory of mind'. We have reason to believe that autistic children lack such a 'theory'. If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using Wimmer and Perner's puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those with Down's syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs to others.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {\textgreater} or =10 had a sensitivity of 88{\%} and a specificity of 88{\%} for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

In addition, these methods have documented advantages over traditional data analytic approaches in the analysis of repeated-measures data. These advantages include, but are not limited to, the ability to incorporate time-varying predictors, handle dependence among repeated observations in a very flexible manner, and to provide accurate estimates with missing data under fairly unrestrictive missing data assumptions. The flexibility of the growth curve modeling approach to the analysis of change makes it the preferred choice in the evaluation of direct, indirect and moderated intervention effects. Although offering many benefits, growth models present challenges in terms of design, analysis and reporting of results. This paper provides a nontechnical overview of growth models in the analysis of change in randomized experiments and advocates for their use in the field of internet interventions. Practical recommendations for design, analysis and reporting of results from growth models are provided.},

Here, we outline a new anatomical model of communication that incorporates previous neurofunctional accounts of language with recent advances in tractography and neuropragmatics.

abstract = {The Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) is a simple widely used 5-item measure of disability whose psychometric properties need more analysis in phobic disorders. The reliability, factor structure, validity, and sensitivity to change of the WSAS were studied in 205 phobic patients (73 agoraphobia, 62 social phobia, and 70 specific phobia) who participated in various open and randomized trials of self-exposure therapy. Internal consistency of the WSAS was excellent in all phobics pooled and in agoraphobics and social phobics separately. Principal components analysis extracted a single general factor of disability. Specific phobics gave less consistent ratings across WSAS items, suggesting that some items were less relevant to their problem. Internal consistency was marginally higher for self-ratings than clinician ratings of the WSAS. Self-ratings and clinician ratings correlated highly though patients tended to rate themselves as more disabled than clinicians did. WSAS total scores reflected differences in phobic severity and improvement with treatment. The WSAS is a valid, reliable, and change-sensitive measure of work/social and other adjustment in phobic disorders, especially in agoraphobia and social phobia. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Policymakers are interested in early-years interventions to ameliorate childhood risks. They hope for improved adult outcomes in the long run that bring a return on investment. The size of the return that can be expected partly depends on how strongly child-hood risks forecast adult outcomes, but there is disagreement about whether childhood determines adulthood. We integrated multiple nationwide administrative databases and electronic medical records with the four-decade-long Dunedin birth cohort study to test child-to-adult prediction in a different way, using a population-segmentation approach. A segment comprising 22{\%} of the cohort accounted for 36{\%} of the cohort's injury insurance claims; 40{\%} of excess obese kilograms; 54{\%} of cigarettes smoked; 57{\%} of hospital nights; 66{\%} of welfare benefits; 77{\%} of fatherless child-rearing; 78{\%} of prescription fills; and 81{\%} of criminal convictions. Childhood risks, including poor brain health at three years of age, predicted this segment with large effect sizes. Early-years interventions that are effective for this population segment could yield very large returns on investment. A round the world, the population is ageing and total fertil-ity rates are declining. As a result, nations increasingly view children and young people as valuable resources for the economic and social well-being of whole societies. This view is accompanied by public-policy interest in early interventions to help as many children as possible achieve their full potential. A key question concerns the potential size of the impact that might be brought about by interventions in the early years of children's lives 1,2},

abstract = {Rule-governed behaviours enable rapid acquisition of appropriate and often complex behaviour in novel contexts; however, this capacity can also make individuals insensitive to environmental contingencies. This problem may be exacerbated if rules propagate from one context to another through derived relational responding. Here we assessed whether insensitivity due to rule-following would transfer to stimuli that were never directly associated with that rule, by means of combinatorial entailment. Multiple reinforcement schedules (1A = VR8; 2A = DRL8) were initially presented to two groups, one receiving rules on how to behave to earn as many points as possible, the other not receiving any rule. The participants then completed a matching-to-sample task in which equivalence classes were trained in a one-to-many format (1A ⟵ 1B → 1C; 2A ⟵ 12B → 2C). Finally, the derived stimuli (1C and 2C) were presented in a second multiple-schedule task, where the associated schedules were reversed (1C = DRL8; 2C = VR8), without informing the participants. Results demonstrated that insensitivity transferred to the stimuli set in equivalence for the participants who received rules, while participants who did not receive any rule adapted quicker to the contingencies changes. Results are discussed in relation to behavioural variability and psychological inflexibility that contributes to the development and maintenance of psychological issues.},

However, school refusal behaviour can be successfully treated provided there has been a sound assessment. We outline an hypothesis-testing, multi-informant assessment approach that incorporates diagnostic interviewing, functional analysis assessment, self-report measures, parent/teacher checklists and review of school attendance records. Further, it is shown how assessment information facilitates individual treatment planning for the school-refusing child and family.

abstract = {The first wave of behavior therapy countered the excesses and scientific weakness of existing nonempirical clinical traditions through empirically studied first-order change efforts linked to behavioral principles targeting directly relevant clinical tar-gets. The second wave was characterized by similar direct change efforts guided by social learning and cognitive principles that included cognitive in addition to behav-ioral and emotive targets. Various factors seem to have set the stage for a third wave, including anomalies in the current literature and philosophical changes. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is one of a number of new interventions from both behavioral and cognitive wings that seem to be moving the field in a different direc-tion. ACT is explicitly contextualistic and is based on a basic experimental analysis of human language and cognition, Relational Frame Theory (RFF). RFT explains why cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance are both ubiquitous and harmful. ACT targets these processes and is producing supportive data both at the process and outcome level. The third-wave treatments are characterized by openness to older clinical traditions, a focus on second order and contextual change, an emphasis of function over form, and the construction of flexible and effective repertoires, among other features. They build on the first-and second-wave treatments, but seem to be carrying the behavior therapy tradition forward into new territory. Over the last several years quite a number of behavior therapies have emerged that do not fit easily into traditional categories within the field.},

abstract = {Background: Preliminary data support the implementation of individual metacognitive therapy (MCT) for depression. Given the focus of MCT on transpersonal processes, we hypothesized that this treatment should translate well to a group format. In this study, the effects and feasibility associated with group MCT for depression are reported. Methods: Eleven patients who were consecutively referred by general practitioners to a specialist psychiatric practice in Norway participated in an open trial of the effects and feasibility associated with group MCT for depression. All of the patients met the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) and were monitored in a baseline period before attending 90-min weekly treatment sessions of group MCT for 10 weeks. The primary symptom outcome measure was severity of depression whilst secondary outcome measures included levels of anxiety, rumination and metacognitive beliefs. We also assessed recovery rates and changes in comorbid Axis I and Axis II diagnoses. Results: Large clinically significant improvements across all measures were detected at post-treatment and these were maintained at follow-up. Based on objectively defined recovery criteria, all patients were classified as recovered at post-treatment and 91{\%} at 6 months follow-up. The intervention was also associated with significant reductions in comorbid diagnoses. Conclusions: These preliminary data indicate that group MCT in the treatment of depression is effective, well accepted and it extends clinical application of MCT for depression to group formats as a potential cost-effective intervention.

abstract = {The job demandsϪresources (JD-R) model was introduced in the international literature 15 years ago (Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, {\&} Schaufeli, 2001). The model has been applied in thousands of organizations and has inspired hundreds of empirical articles, including 1 of the most downloaded articles of the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology (Bakker, Demerouti, {\&} Euwema, 2005). This article provides evidence for the buffering role of various job resources on the impact of various job demands on burnout. In the present article, we look back on the first 10 years of the JD-R model (2001–2010), and discuss how the model matured into JD-R theory (2011–2016). Moreover, we look at the future of the theory and outline which new issues in JD-R theory are worthwhile of investigation. We also discuss practical applications. It is our hope that JD-R theory will continue to inspire researchers and practitioners who want to promote employee well-being and effective organizational functioning. We were delighted with the invitation to take stock of job demands–resources (JD-R) theory. Our article " Job resources buf-fer the impact of job demands on burnout " (Bakker, Demerouti, {\&} Euwema, 2005) featured in the 2nd issue of Volume 10 of the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, and turned out to be one of the most cited articles in the 20 years of the journal. The article reports on a study among more than 1000 employees of a large institute for higher education. The results showed work overload, emotional job demands, physical job demands, and work-home conflict are all risk factors for job burnout (particularly exhaustion and cynicism), but that the undesirable impact of job demands on burnout can be alleviated by job resources such as job autonomy, social support, quality of the relationship with the supervisor, and performance feedback. The JD-R model was introduced in the English literature 15 years ago (Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, {\&} Schaufeli, 2001). Since then, the model has been applied in thousands of organiza-tions, and inspired hundreds of empirical studies (for a recent overview and meta-analyses, see Bakker, Demerouti, {\&} Sanz-Vergel, 2014; Crawford, LePine, {\&} Rich, 2010; Halbesleben, 2010; Nahrgang, Morgeson, {\&} Hofmann, 2011). Moreover, as indicated by one of the reviewers of this article, the JD-R model (and the job demands—resources distinction) has been used by many Occupational Health and Safety/Workplace Health {\&} Safety regulators and government agencies around the world (especially in the United Kingdom, Europe, Canada, and Australia) to inform psychosocial education policies/activities and risk assessment ap-proaches. In the present article, we look back on the first 10 years of the JD-R model (2001–2010) and discuss how the model matured into JD-R theory (2011–2016). Moreover, we look at the future of the theory and outline which new issues in JD-R theory are worthwhile of investigation. We also discuss practical appli-cations. Whereas the JD-R model was originally used to explain burnout, it now accounts for various types of employee well-being. This is what we discuss first.},

Harry Heft's (2001) Ecological Psychology in Context provides an occasion for reviewing anew those relations and affinities. It describes the genesis of ecological psychology in James's radical empiricism; addresses Holt's neorealism and Gestalt psychology; and synthesizes Gibson's ecological psychology and Barker's ecobehavioral science as a means for understanding everyday human behavior. Although behavior analysis is excluded from this account, Heft's book warrants a review nonetheless: It describes ecological psychology in ways that are congruent and complementary with behavior analysis (e.g., nonmediational theorizing; the provinces of natural history and natural science). After introducing modern ecological psychology, I comment on (a) Heft's admirable, albeit selective, historiography; (b) his ecological psychology—past and present— as it relates to Skinner's science and system (e.g., affordances, molar behavior); (c) his misunderstandings of Skinner's behaviorism (e.g., reductionistic, mechanistic, molecular); and (d) the theoretical status of Heft's cognitive terms and talk (i.e., in ontology, epistemology, syntax). I conclude by considering the alliance and integration of ecological psychology and behavior analysis, and their implications for unifying and transforming psychology as a life science, albeit more for the future than at present.},

abstract = {Imagery is a powerful psychotherapeutic technique, but one that is potentially risky as individuals can mistake an imagined experience for an autobiographical one. Two experiments examined whether repeatedly imagining the same scenario influences the likelihood of such errors. Repetition increased the similarity between phenomenological ratings of imagery and autobiographical memory: After three repetitions, imagery ratings were equal to those for memories. However, repetition also increased recognition and source accuracy for both autobiographical memories and imagery, indicating that repetition may have contrasting effects when one is using heuristic versus systematic source monitoring processes. These results suggest that psychotherapists should not repeat imagery scenarios for legally-relevant issues, unless systematic source judgment processes can be assured, to protect clients from potential memory errors associated with therapeutic imagery.},

abstract = {The authors present several personal studies in accordance with other published data which contest the existence of purely psychogenic bronchial asthma, as it was considered 30-50 years ago. Although psychological stimuli could trigger the occurrence of attacks of bronchial asthma, they are not an exclusive etiological factor (Iamandescu, 1980, 1985). In the context of large groups of asthma with allergic or other etiology, forms of asthma that are triggered by an additional psychogenic factor could be identified. These are noted in 62.5{\%} of hospitalized patients, most cases with a prolonged and more severe evolution of the disease, but in only 30{\%} of light and moderately severe cases that are followed up in outpatient (Iamandescu, 1980, 1984). The percent of psychological trigger is maximum (86{\%}) in corticodependent asthma patients (Iamandescu, 1996). Somatic and psychological background of asthma with psychogenic triggering is represented by the following: (1) an obvious relationship between psychological stimuli and the onset of asthma attacks, and a psychological terrain "endowed" with an increased vulnerability to stress. These patients present a diminished rate of cortisol response to stress compared with asthma patients without psychogenic triggering; (2) reversibility to broncho-dilator agents, in contrast with resistance to systemic corticoid therapy; (3) sensitivity to aspirin; (4) endocrine dysfunctions (high estrogen and thyroid hormones secretion); (5) multi-factorial triggering of the attacks (especially non-specific respiratory irritants, including physical-chemical factors and meteorological changes) (1985); (6) variable response to psychotherapy and psychotropic drugs, suggesting--in case of therapeutic failure--the predominance of the chronic inflammation determined by other etiologic agents, different from psychological stress.},

The bulk of their re-examination of my article is divided into four parts: a) Selection of studies, b) Ratings of methodological quality, c) Meta-analysis, and d) Judgments of quality of evidence. It is evident from my paper that I have refuted their claims regarding each of these parts. Regarding a) Selection of studies I showed that only four studies had a cell size of less than 10 and their inclusion did not change the mean effect size or increased variability. Concerning b) Ratings of methodological quality I have showed that my ratings were reliable and had accuracy. As for c) Meta-analysis, I have demonstrated that I got very similar results to those of A-Tjak et al. (2015) that Atkins et al. describes as a much better meta-analysis. Regarding d) Judgments of quality of evidence, Atkins et al. brought up 23 studies for which they argued that I have done an incorrect evaluation but for every single study I have disproved their arguments and maintain my 2014 evaluation of the evidence base of ACT. Thus, there is no reason to follow Atkins et al. suggestion that my review “should now be set aside in making decisions regarding the treatment efficacy of ACT.”},

abstract = {An account of the neurological mechanisms that underlie binding is given which is characterized by the decomposition of the binding problem into three distinct subproblems. Each subproblem is then supported by anatomically specialized brain regions. The posterior cortex employs coarse-coded dis-tributed representations of low-order conjunctions to resolve binding ambiguities, while also supporting systematic generalization to novel stimuli and situations. These representations are slowly acquired over experience. The hippocampus can more rapidly bind higher-order conjunctions of information such as episodes or locations. Finally, the prefrontal cortex supports transient, actively maintained bindings that are used in the service of working memory. We argue that this approach to the binding problem compares favorably with those based on temporal synchrony binding.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Organisational-level workplace interventions are thought to produce more sustainable effects on the health of employees than interventions targeting individual behaviours. However, scientific evidence from intervention studies does not fully support this notion. It is therefore important to explore conditions of positive health effects by systematically reviewing available studies. We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of 39 health-related intervention studies targeting a variety of working conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Systematic review. Organisational-level workplace interventions aiming at improving employees' health were identified in electronic databases and manual searches. The appraisal of studies was adapted from the Cochrane Back Review Group guidelines. To improve comparability of the widely varying studies we classified the interventions according to the main approaches towards modifying working conditions. Based on this classification we applied a logistic regression model to estimate significant intervention effects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 39 intervention studies published between 1993 and 2012 were included. In terms of methodology the majority of interventions were of medium quality, and four studies only had a high level of evidence. About half of the studies (19) reported significant effects. There was a marginally significant probability of reporting effects among interventions targeting several organisational-level modifications simultaneously (Odds ratio (OR) 2.71; 95{\%} CI 0.94-11.12), compared to those targeting one dimension only.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Despite the heterogeneity of the 39 organisational-level workplace interventions underlying this review, we were able to compare their effects by applying broad classification categories. Success rates were higher among more comprehensive interventions tackling material, organisational and work-time related conditions simultaneously. To increase the number of successful organisational-level interventions in the future, commonly reported obstacles against the implementation process should be addressed in developing these studies.},

In health care, assertiveness may play an important role in health outcomes, especially for predominantly minority populations, such as adults with sickle cell disease. Therefore, it is important to develop measures to accurately assess assertiveness. It is also important to reduce response burden of lengthy instruments while retaining instrument reliability and validity. The purpose of this article is to describe development of a shorter version of the Simple Rathus Assertiveness Schedule (SRAS). Design: Data from a cross-sectional descriptive study of adults with sickle cell disease were used to construct a short form of the SRAS, guided by stepwise regression analysis. Results: The 19-item Simple Rathus Assertiveness Scale'Short Form (SRAS-SF) had acceptable reliability ($\alpha$ =.81) and construct validity and was highly correlated with the SRAS (r =.98, p =.01). Conclusions: The SRAS-SF reduces response burden, while maintaining reliability and validity. {\textcopyright} 2010, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

A baseline period was followed by weekly sessions with follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months post treatment. Large and statistically significant improvements occurred in all symptom measures at post treatment and were maintained over follow-up. Two out of 3 process measures significantly improved at post treatment and all of these measures were improved at follow-up. Treatment was associated with similar response rates on the BDI and Hamilton rating scale. Using liberal criteria 80{\%} of completers were classified as recovered at post treatment and 70{\%} at follow-up on the BDI. In the intention to treat sample 66.6{\%} were recovered at post treatment and 58.3{\%} at follow-up. More stringent criteria showed 60{\%} recovery rates at post treatment and at 12. m. The results suggest that MCT could be a brief and effective treatment and they provide a precedent for more definitive randomized controlled trials. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Psychological therapists commonly fail to adhere to treatment protocols in everyday clinical practice. In part, this pattern of drift is attributable to anxious therapists being less likely to undertake some elements of evidence-based therapies - particularly the exposure-based elements. This study considers what facets of anxiety (cognitive, behavioral, physiological) are related to junior clinicians' reported use of cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques. Thirty-two clinicians (mean age = 28.9 years; mean length of CBT experience = 1.5 years; 23 female, nine male) who offered CBT were assessed for their cognitive, behavioral and physiological characteristics (Intolerance of Uncertainty scale; risk taking; skin conductance response and heart rate variability). While the three different facets of anxiety were relatively poorly associated with each other, as is usual in this literature, each facet was linked differently to the reported delivery of CBT techniques (P {\textless}.05). Overall, higher anxiety levels were associated with a poorer use of exposure methods or with a greater use of other behavioral or cognitive methods. Of the three facets of anxiety, only physiological reactivity showed an association with the clinicians' temporal characteristics, with more experienced therapists being more likely to have greater skin conductance responses to positive and negative outcomes. These findings suggest that clinicians who are more anxious are less likely to deliver the full evidence-based form of CBT and to focus instead on less challenging elements of the therapy. Potential ways of overcoming this limitation are discussed.},

The relationship between therapist competence and patient outcomes was explored. Trainees achieved competence during training (100{\%}, n = 45) and largely maintained competence post-training (84{\%}, n = 38). Patients demonstrated pre-to-posttreatment effect sizes between 1.38 and 1.89 and reliable improvement exceeding 80{\%} during and after training. Competence was not significantly associated with patient outcome. Trainees predominantly maintained competence and achieved good clinical outcomes post-training. Structured training and continued use of regular supervision possibly supported retention of competence.},

abstract = {The field of music therapy has a long history of using music in various ways to help restore, improve or maintain mental and physical health. Specific examples include: (1) brain injured clients playing musical instruments and/or listening to selected music to capitalize on the organizing properties of rhythm as an aid to synchronization of movements; (2) melodic intonation therapy being invoked where aphasic persons with intact ability to verbalize through singing are encouraged to sing (intone) selected words or sentences, with the melodic aspects gradually fading out with continued practice; and (3) behavior modification training incorporating music used as a powerful reinforcement (by providing a patient with the opportunity to listen to a favorite music piece) for engaging in desired behaviors. A related and relatively new approach is brain music treatment (BMT). It is a form of neurofeedback which involves converting aspects of a person's brain electrical activity (EEG) into two musical files recorded on a CD. The person then listens to these selections over a period of a few weeks. The specific underlying mechanisms have not been determined. Nonetheless, high rates of success in improving sleep patterns have been achieved through decreasing anxiety when using a relaxing file, and promoting focus and sustained attention when using an activating file. This chapter describes the clinical practice of BMT, reviews existing scientific literature on the topic, speculates on mechanisms for the therapeutic effectiveness of BMT (with special emphasis on entrainment/disentrainment of brain electrical activity as a possible mechanism), and discusses the future promise of BMT as a therapeutic modality.},

abstract = {A growing body of literature suggests that organizational leadership is linked to a wide variety of employee outcomes, both positive and negative, relevant to occupational health and safety. All organizations have individuals in a leadership role, but few researchers consider leadership training as an effective intervention. This may be because such studies are difficult to conduct and because the target, being the employees, is indirect. In this paper for the special edition of Work {\&} Stress, we review studies linking leadership to individual well-being and safety in organizations. These include studies concerning leadership style, abusive supervision and organizational fairness. We highlight intervention studies that suggest that these linkages are causal and that leadership development, usually in the form of training, is an effective intervention in occupational health psychology. It is proposed that leadership development should be a main target for research on interventions in Occupational health psychology. The characteristics of leadership development interventions and directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

It is based on a subdivision of language processing into three components: Memory, Unification, and Control. The functional components as well as the neurobiological underpinnings of the model are discussed. In addition, the need for extension of the model beyond the classical core regions for language is shown. The attention network and the network for inferential processing are crucial to realize language comprehension beyond single word processing and beyond decoding propositional content. It is shown that this requires the dynamic interaction between multiple brain regions.},

abstract = {Teams of people working together for a common purpose have been a centerpiece of human social organization ever since our ancient ancestors first banded together to hunt game, raise families, and defend their communities. Human history is largely a story of people working together in groups to explore, achieve, and conquer. Yet, the modern concept of work in large organizations that developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is largely a tale of work as a collection of individual jobs. A variety of global forces unfolding over the last two decades, however, has pushed organizations worldwide to restructure work around teams, to enable more rapid, flexible, and adaptive responses to the unexpected. This shift in the structure of work has made team effectiveness a salient organizational concern. Teams touch our lives everyday and their effectiveness is important to well-being across a wide range of societal functions. There is over 50 years of psychological research literally thousands of studies-focused on understanding and influencing the processes that underlie team effectiveness. Our goal in this monograph is to sift through this voluminous literature to identify what we know, what we think we know, and what we need to know to improve the effectiveness of work groups and teams. We begin by defining team effectiveness and establishing the conceptual underpinnings of our approach to understanding it. We then turn to our review, which concentrates primarily on topics that have well-developed theoretical and empirical foundations, to ensure that our conclusions and recommendations are on firm footing. Our review begins by focusing on cognitive, motivational/affective, and behavioral team processes-processes that enable team members to combine their resources to resolve task demands and, in so doing, be effective. We then turn our attention to identifying interventions, or ''levers,'' that can shape or align team processes and thereby provide tools and applications that can improve team effectiveness. Topic-specific conclusions and recommendations are given throughout the review. There is a solid foundation for concluding that there is an emerging science of team effectiveness and that findings from this research foundation provide several means to improve team effectiveness. In the concluding section, we summarize our primary findings to highlight specific research, application, and policy recommendations for enhancing the effectiveness of work groups and teams.},

abstract = {We investigated the effects of intranasal oxytocin (OXT) on trust and cooperation in borderline personality disorder (BPD), a disorder marked by interpersonal instability and difficulties with cooperation. Although studies in healthy adults show that intranasal OXT increases trust, individuals with BPD may show an altered response to exogenous OXT because the effects of OXT on trust and pro-social behavior may vary depending on the relationship representations and expectations people possess and/or altered OXT system functioning in BPD. BPD and control participants received intranasal OXT and played a social dilemma game with a partner. Results showed that OXT produced divergent effects in BPD participants, decreasing trust and the likelihood of cooperative responses. Additional analyses focusing on individual differences in attachment anxiety and avoidance across BPD and control participants indicate that these divergent effects were driven by the anxiously attached, rejection-sensitive participants. These data suggest that OXT does not uniformly facilitate trust and pro-social behavior in humans; indeed, OXT may impede trust and pro-social behavior depending on chronic interpersonal insecurities, and/or possible neurochemical differences in the OXT system. Although popularly dubbed the 'hormone of love', these data suggest a more circumspect answer to the question of who will benefit from OXT.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Two studies using cross-sectional designs explored four possible mechanisms by which loneliness may have deleterious effects on health: health behaviors, cardiovascular activation, cortisol levels, and sleep. METHODS: In Study 1, we assessed autonomic activity, salivary cortisol levels, sleep quality, and health behaviors in 89 undergraduate students selected based on pretests to be among the top or bottom quintile in feelings of loneliness. In Study 2, we assessed blood pressure, heart rate, salivary cortisol levels, sleep quality, and health behaviors in 25 older adults whose loneliness was assessed at the time of testing at their residence. RESULTS: Total peripheral resistance was higher in lonely than nonlonely participants, whereas cardiac contractility, heart rate, and cardiac output were higher in nonlonely than lonely participants. Lonely individuals also reported poorer sleep than nonlonely individuals. Study 2 indicated greater age-related increases in blood pressure and poorer sleep quality in lonely than nonlonely older adults. Mean salivary cortisol levels and health behaviors did not differ between groups in either study. CONCLUSIONS: Results point to two potentially orthogonal predisease mechanisms that warrant special attention: cardiovascular activation and sleep dysfunction. Health behavior and cortisol regulation, however, may require more sensitive measures and large sample sizes to discern their roles in loneliness and health.},

Background An adequate scale is needed to measure the assertiveness and the effect of assertion training for Japanese nurses and to compare them with those in other countries. Methods Rathus Assertiveness Schedule was adapted to Japanese with back-translation and its validity was examined in 989 novice nurses. Results The Japanese version showed a high coefficient of reliability in a split-half reliability test (r = 0.76; P {\textless} 0.01). The coefficient of reliability of Cronbach's alpha was high (r = 0.84; P {\textless} 0.01) indicating high internal consistency. The similarity with the concept of stress coping was shown. We extracted eight principal factors using factor analysis with varimax rotation. Elements of these factors were similar to those of the original Rathus Assertiveness Schedule.

abstract = {Metacognitive therapy (MCT) for depression is derived from the Wells and Matthews (1994) self-regulatory model, in which a Cognitive-Attentional Syndrome (CAS) is the cause of psychological disorders. MCT for depression focuses on identifying patients' CAS and helps them to stop it. The CAS consists of worry, rumination and dysfunctional coping strategies. The focus in MCT is on removing the CAS by challenging positive and negative metacognitive beliefs and eliminating dysfunctional behaviors. In this case series, MCT was delivered to four depressed Danes and treatment was evaluated in 5-11 sessions of up to one hour each. An A-B design with follow-up at 3 and 6 months was conducted and the primary outcome was Beck's Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). We measured CAS processes with the Major depressive Disorder Scale (MDD-S). The results of the case series showed clinically significant improvements in depressive symptoms, rumination and metacognitive beliefs and the effects were still present at follow-up for all patients. The small number of patients and decreasing baselines observed in some cases limits the conclusions. However, the results suggest that this treatment is feasible and was associated with large improvements in symptoms when delivered away from its point of origin and in a Danish help-seeking sample.},

abstract = {Anxiety disorders (separation anxiety disorder, selective mutism, specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and generalised anxiety disorder) are common and disabling conditions that mostly begin during childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. They differ from developmentally normative or stress-induced transient anxiety by being marked (ie, out of proportion to the actual threat present) and persistent, and by impairing daily functioning. Most anxiety disorders affect almost twice as many women as men. They often co-occur with major depression, alcohol and other substance-use disorders, and personality disorders. Differential diagnosis from physical conditions—including thyroid, cardiac, and respiratory disorders, and substance intoxication and withdrawal—is imperative. If untreated, anxiety disorders tend to recur chronically. Psychological treatments, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy, and pharmacological treatments, particularly selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and serotonin–noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitors, are effective, and their combination could be more effective than is treatment with either individually. More research is needed to increase access to and to develop personalised treatments.},

abstract = {Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, or high-frequency heart-rate variability) is frequently employed as an index of cardiac vagal tone or even believed to be a direct measure of vagal tone. However, there are many significant caveats regarding vagal tone interpretation: 1. Respiratory parameters can confound relations between RSA and cardiac vagal tone. 2. Although intraindividual relations between RSA and cardiac vagal control are often strong, interindividual associations may be modest. 3. RSA measurement is profoundly influenced by concurrent levels of momentary physical activity, which can bias estimation of individual differences in vagal tone. 4. RSA magnitude is affected by beta-adrenergic tone. 5. RSA and cardiac vagal tone can dissociate under certain circumstances. 6. The polyvagal theory contains evolution-based speculations that relate RSA, vagal tone and behavioral phenomena. We present evidence that the polyvagal theory does not accurately depict evolution of vagal control of heart-rate variability, and that it ignores the phenomenon of cardiac aliasing and disregards the evolution of a functional role for vagal control of the heart, from cardiorespiratory synchrony in fish to RSA in mammals. Unawareness of these issues can lead to misinterpretation of cardiovascular autonomic mechanisms. On the other hand, RSA has been shown to often provide a reasonable reflection of cardiac vagal tone when the above-mentioned complexities are considered. Finally, a recent hypothesis is expanded upon, in which RSA plays a primary role in regulation of energy exchange by means of synchronizing respiratory and cardiovascular processes during metabolic and behavioral change. {\#}},

abstract = {An integrative model of short-term dynamic psycho- therapy (STDP) is presented that assimilates interven- tions from a variety of therapy orientations to acceler- ate patient improvement. Affect phobia therapy (APT) is a name given to McCullough's STDP to highlight the main treatment focus and to guide therapists to the most efficient and effective interventions. This treat- ment model is based on the hypothesis that conflicts about feelings, or “affect phobias,” are the fundamen- tal issues underlying many Axis I and Axis II disorders. Systematic desensitization, or stepwise exposure to feelings and defense response prevention, is hypothe- sized to be the fundamental agent of therapeutic change. APT focuses primarily on the resolution of af- fective conflicts in a psychodynamic framework, but videotape review and process studies of this STDP model have discovered that interventions from cogni- tive, behavior, Gestalt, and experiential therapy, as well as self-psychology, have been instrumental in patient change. Therapy is made briefer by clarifying treatment objectives, simplifying the selection criteria, and using principles of systematic desensitization for the resolu- tion of affect phobias.},

abstract = {Habib Davanloo has spent his career developing and teaching methods to accelerate dynamic psy-chotherapy, including his technique of intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy (ISTDP). Over the past 20 years, outcome studies using this treatment have been conducted and published. We per-formed a systematic review of the literature to obtain studies presenting ISTDP outcome data. We found 21 studies (10 controlled, and 11 uncontrolled) reporting the effects of ISTDP in patients with mood, anxiety, personality, and somatic disorders. Using the random-effects model, we performed meta-analyses including 13 of these studies and found pre-to post-treatment effect sizes (Cohen's d) ranging from 0.84 (interpersonal problems) to 1.51 (depression). Post-treatment to follow-up effect sizes suggested that these gains were maintained at follow-up. Based on post-treatment effect sizes, ISTDP was significantly more efficacious than control conditions (d = 1.18; general psychopathol-ogy measures). Study quality was highly variable, and there was significant heterogeneity in some analyses. Eight studies using various measures suggested ISTDP was cost-effective. Within limita-tions of study methodologies, this evidence supports the application of ISTDP across a broad range of populations. Further rigorous and targeted research into this method is warranted.

TES consists of emotional activation of a problematic emotional state followed by the activation of adaptive emotional state(s) within a short window of time. The resulting change is the creation of a permanent connection between previously unintegrated maladaptive emotional memory networks and adaptive emotional networks. Memory reconsolidation provides a plausible explanation for the mechanism underlying the effectiveness of TES. I compare TES to exposure, and argue that it is the intervention of choice for transforming maladaptive emotions, whereas exposure is most appropriate for accessing disowned and avoided experiences., (C) 2012 by the American Psychological Association},

We report here that many of these neurons become active also when the monkey observes specific, meaningful hand movements performed by the experimenters. The effective experimenters' movements include among others placing or retrieving a piece of food from a table, grasping food from another experimenter's hand, and manipulating objects. There is always a clear link between the effective observed movement and that executed by the monkey and, often, only movements of the experimenter identical to those controlled by a given neuron are able to activate it. These findings indicate that premotor neurons can retrieve movements not only on the basis of stimulus characteristics, as previously described, but also on the basis of the meaning of the observed actions.},

abstract = {This article describes the findings of a 3-month study on how social encounters mediated by an online Virtual Immersive Environment (VIE) impacted on the relational self-concept of adolescents. The study gathered data from two groups of students as they took an Introduction to Design and Programming class. Students in group 1 undertook course activities conducted in the Second Life VIE, where they envisioned themselves as college students five years in the future and developed representational avatars based on that idea. Students in group 2 undertook the same course activities in a different order, without the VIE component during the study period. Changes in self-concept were measured at the conclusion of the study period using the Relational Self-Concept Scale, a survey instrument that examines the impact that different social encounters within and around the school context have upon the formation of self-concept (Schott, G., {\&} Bellin, W. (2001a). The relational self-concept scale: A context-specific self-report measure for adolescents. Adoles-cence, 36, 85–103.). The study found evidence that the VIE experience of group 1 had a significant impact on the students' relational self-concept, specifically a positive change in how content they were with their social selves. This study provides evidence that the development of representational avatars and socializing in a virtual immersive environment can change how adolescents think about themselves in reality.},

The focus of this model is on reciprocity of exchange in occupational life where high-cost/low-gain conditions are considered particularly stressful. Vari- ables measuring low reward, in terms of low status control (e.g., lack of promotion prospects, job insecurity) in association with high extrinsic (e.g., work pressure) or intrinsic (personal coping pattern, e.g., high need for control) effort independently predict new cardiovascular events in a prospective study on blue-collar men. Furthermore, these variables partly explain prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, atherogenic lipids) in 2 independent studies. Studying adverse health effects of high-effort/low-reward conditions seems well justified, especially in view of recent developments of the labor market. Remarkable},

@article{Guilford2010,
abstract = {The author of this book is well known for his contributions to the understanding of psychological processes and for his work on cognitive therapy, particularly in anxiety disorders. His previous books include a more academic account of metacognition (Wells, 2000), and a guide for clinicians on the treatment of anxiety disorders which has become a much used source book for both novice and experienced cognitive therapists (Wells, 1997). He has also published numerous papers, including some on the outcome of metacognitive therapy, albeit mostly small in scale. Wells laid some of the foundations for metacognitive (as opposed to traditional cognitive) therapy in his 1997 book, but here the potential of metacognition is more fully explored, and applied not only to anxiety based disorders (Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) but also to Major Depression. Wells begins by explaining the theory and nature of metacognitive therapy, and provides an exceptionally clear account of its major constructs in a competent fashion that manages to avoid technical descriptions of the S-REF model on which it is based (Wells {\&} Matthews, 1994). Wells takes particular care to explain the differences between standard cognitive theory/therapy and metacognitive theory/therapy. In brief, it might be said that cognitive behavioural therapy tackles the content of cognitions, while metacognitive therapy tackles the processes that maintain these cognitions. This might appear difficult to understand at first, but Wells makes it very easy for the reader. In metacognitive theory the pattern of responding that creates distress is the Cognitive Attentional Syndrome (CAS), consisting of worry, rumination, fixated attention, and unhelpful self regulatory strategies or coping behaviours. Two types of metacognitive beliefs are thought to maintain the CAS, positive and negative metacognitive beliefs. Positive beliefs concern the usefulness of worry, rumination, threat monitoring or other similar strategies (e.g. Focussing on danger will keep me safe). Negative beliefs concern the uncontrollability of thoughts, danger, importance and meaning of them (e.g. " Thinking something makes it true "). This chapter is the best account I have read of how the metacognitive approach differs from standard CBT. Moreover, it is well illustrated with clear and helpful diagrams to show exactly how metacognitive theory differs from standard cognitive behavioural theory, and how each thus has different implications for therapy. In the subsequent chapter Wells describes what needs to be included in assessment when considering a metacognitive therapy formulation and treatment plan. Crucially, such information is also important for monitoring and evaluating the outcome of therapy and so measures for monitoring patients on a weekly basis are also included. A number of self report questionnaires which might assist assessment are discussed, and the majority of these are helpfully included in the Appendices, with permission to use them. Two key treatment strategies are then outlined in detail, with a whole chapter devoted to each. Firstly, attention training techniques are presented, with sufficient detail and tips for the (appropriately qualified) reader to implement them. Secondly, detached mindfulness is treated in the same way. Both chapters deal with presenting the rationale to the patient, describe " how to " do the strategies, and incorporate detailed session plans and use of homework. Separate chapters then follow on GAD, PTSD, OCD and major depression. These chapters each have a similar format, covering the relevant metacognitive model, a typical formulation, and make use of lots of clinical material not only to cover eliciting a formulation and socialisation, but also to illustrate " how to " do metacognitive modification, and relapse prevention. Some very detailed and specific strategies and experiments are described to assist socialisation, and then to modify metacognitions in each chapter. Verbal reattribution is used, behavioural experiments are designed to maximise the chances that the patient will disconfirms his beliefs (for example, by pushing worry, or trying hard to lose, say, control, of their worries). Therapist and patient search for counterevidence, including questioning the mechanism (for example, asking, how does worry cause harm to the body?). Case formulation models are in diagrammatic form in the Appendices, one for each of the disorders discussed in the book, accompanied by useful questions to elicit the various aspects of the formulation for each patient. Each of the four disorders involve rather different recommended strategies, and both attention control and detached mindfulness are not recommended for every disorder, but applied based on a theoretical rationale about the nature of each disorder. The same applies to specific therapy techniques, which are tailored for the different nature of each disorder. This means that there is not a great deal of repetition in the disorder specific chapters. Treatment plans are outlined, and contained in the appendices. Although these are clear and useful, it did feel slightly frustrating that they were not contained in the main text, but this is only a very minor complaint, and the advantage of displaying them in the appendices is that they can easily be photocopied and used without text copied onto the page. The plans are useful in that they suggest potential topics for each session, typically up to 10 sessions are thought necessary. The treatment chapters have good clinical examples, including examples of questions the therapist can ask to uncover specific processes or coping strategies, and example of dialogue between the therapist and patient when addressing particular issues. Towards the end of the book the empirical evidence for metacognitive theory and therapy is presented, with some impressive treatment effects having been obtained, although currently only for relatively small scale studies. This is a useful chapter for those looking for research ideas, and perhaps might inspire some larger scale treatment studies, which definitely appear warranted on the basis of these results. Overall this is a clear and focussed book. It is probably not most helpful for the novice therapist, in that many basic therapy skills are not covered, but it will provide the appropriately trained therapist with the specific guidance needed to begin to understand the theory behind metacognitve therapy, and many of the specific skills that are required to put the therapy into practice. In short, it is the perfect treatment manual for those wishing to try a relatively novel therapy. This is particularly important at a time when many are questioning the ability of CBT to help all patients, and searching for alternatives for those who fail to respond to CBT. Wells has written and published on metacognitive theory and therapy in various books and journals, but this book is a star in that it brings this knowledge into a coherent and easy to digest summary. It is also accessible in a way that many books and articles on this topic are not. There is also much for researchers to learn from reading the summaries of theory, evidence and case examples. Indeed both researchers and therapists should enjoy this book, and it makes a nice, timely and significant contribution.},

In this review, research on clinical features, boundary issues, and naturalistic course, as well as risk factors and maintaining mechanisms (cognitive, biological, neural, interpersonal, and developmental), are presented. A synthesis of these data points to a central role of emotional hyperreactivity, sensitivity to contrasting emotions, and dysfunctional attempts to cope with strong emotional shifts via worry. Consistent with the Contrast Avoidance model, evidence shows that worry evokes and sustains negative affect, thereby precluding sharp increases in negative emotion. We also review current treatment paradigms and suggest how the Contrast Avoidance model may help to target key fears and avoidance tendencies that serve to maintain pathology in GAD.},

abstract = {If the language of the brain lies in its neuronal coding, then the expression of the brain lies in its rhythmicity and timing. The rhythmicity is due to the selective synchronization and desynchronization of the encoding within billions of pools of neurons which provide the sensory activity of everything that is sensed, thought, or done. Berger (1929) observed all four main rhythms—the alpha, beta, theta, and delta—in his very first EEG recording. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that since the earliest EEG studies, interest has turned toward rhythmic sensory stimulation, and its possible effects on brain function. A large and growing body of research and clinical experience demonstrates that audio-visual entrainment (AVE) quickly and effectively modifies conditions of high autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) activation and over- and under-aroused states of mind, bringing about a return to homeostasis. AVE exerts a powerful influence on brain/mind stabilization and normalization by means of increased cerebral flow, increased levels of certain neurotransmitters, and by normalizing EEG activity. AVE is proving to be a safe and cost-effective treatment, especially for the large numbers of disorders associated with dysfunctions of the central and autonomic nervous system.},

@article{Alderson-Day2017,
abstract = {These authors contributed equally to this work. Auditory verbal hallucinations (hearing voices) are typically associated with psychosis, but a minority of the general population also experience them frequently and without distress. Such 'non-clinical' experiences offer a rare and unique opportunity to study hallucinations apart from confounding clinical factors, thus allowing for the identification of symptom-specific mechanisms. Recent theories propose that hallucinations result from an imbalance of prior expectation and sensory information, but whether such an imbalance also influences auditory-perceptual processes remains unknown. We examine for the first time the cortical processing of ambiguous speech in people without psychosis who regularly hear voices. Twelve non-clinical voice-hearers and 17 matched controls completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while passively listening to degraded speech ('sine-wave' speech), that was either potentially intelligible or unintelligible. Voice-hearers reported recognizing the presence of speech in the stimuli before controls, and before being explicitly informed of its intelligibility. Across both groups, intelligible sine-wave speech engaged a typical left-lateralized speech processing network. Notably, however, voice-hearers showed stronger intelligibility re-sponses than controls in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and in the superior frontal gyrus. This suggests an enhanced involve-ment of attention and sensorimotor processes, selectively when speech was potentially intelligible. Altogether, these behavioural and neural findings indicate that people with hallucinatory experiences show distinct responses to meaningful auditory stimuli. A greater weighting towards prior knowledge and expectation might cause non-veridical auditory sensations in these individuals, but it might also spontaneously facilitate perceptual processing where such knowledge is required. This has implications for the understanding of hallucinations in clinical and non-clinical populations, and is consistent with current 'predictive processing' theories of psychosis.

abstract = {Background Considering the ample evidence of involvement of the glutamate system in the pathophysiology of depression, pre-clinical and clinical studies have been conducted to assess the antidepressant efficacy of glutamate inhibition, and glutamate receptor modulators in particular. This review focuses on the use of glutamate receptor modulators in unipolar depression. Objectives To assess the effects -and review the acceptability -of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in comparison to placebo (or saline placebo), other pharmacologically active agents, or electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression in people with unipolar major depressive disorder. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR, to 9 January 2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We did not apply any restrictions to date, language or publication status. Selection criteria Double-or single-blind RCTs comparing ketamine, memantine, or other glutamate receptor modulators with placebo (or saline placebo), other active psychotropic drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults with unipolar major depression. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes for this review were response rate and adverse events. Main results We included 25 studies (1242 participants) on ketamine (9 trials), memantine (3), AZD6765 (3), d-cycloserine (2), Org26576 (2), atomoxetine (1), CP-101,606 (1), MK-0657 (1), N-acetylcysteine (1), riluzole (1) and sarcosine (1). Twenty-one studies were placebo-controlled and the majority were two-arm studies (23 out of 25). Twenty-two studies defined an inclusion criteria specifying the severity of depression; 11 specified at least moderate depression; eight, severe depression; and the remaining three, mild-moderate depression. Nine studies recruited only treatment-resistant patients. We rated the risk of bias as low or unclear for most domains, though lack of detail regarding masking of treatment in the studies reduced our certainty in the effect for all outcomes. We rated three studies as having high risk for selective outcome reporting. Many trials did not provide information on all the prespecified outcomes and we found no data, or very limited data, on very important issues like suicidality, cognition, quality of life, costs to healthcare services and dropouts due to lack of efficacy. Among all glutamate receptor modulators, only ketamine (administered intravenously) proved to be more efficacious than placebo, though the quality of evidence was limited by risk of bias and small sample sizes. There was low quality evidence that treatment with ketamine increased the likelihood of response after 24 hours (odds ratio (OR) 10.77, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 2.00 to 58.00; 3 RCTs, 56 participants), 72 hours (OR 12.59, 95{\%} CI 2.38 to 66.73; 3 RCTs, 56 participants), and one week (OR 2.58, 95{\%} CI 1.08 to 6.16; 4 RCTs, 131 participants). The effect of ketamine was even less certain at two weeks, as data were available from only one trial (OR 0.93, 95{\%} CI 0.31 to 2.83; 51 participants, low quality evidence). This was consistent across all efficacy outcomes. Ketamine caused more confusion and emotional blunting compared to placebo. There was insufficient evidence to determine if this increased the likelihood of leaving the study early (OR 1.90, 95{\%} CI 0.43 to 8.47; 5 RCTs, 139 participants, low quality evidence). One RCT with 72 participants reported higher numbers of responders on ketamine than midazolam at 24 hours (OR 0.36, 95{\%} CI 0.14 to 0.58), 72 hours (OR 0.37, 95{\%} CI 0.16 to 0.59), and one week (OR 0.29, 95{\%} CI 0.08 to 0.49). However, midazolam was better tolerated than ketamine in terms of blurred vision, dizziness, general malaise and nausea/vomiting at 24 hours post-infusion. The evidence contributing to these outcomes was of low quality. We found better efficacy of sarcosine over citalopram at four weeks (OR 6.93, 95{\%} CI 1.53 to 31.38; 1 study, 40 participants), but not at two weeks (OR 8.14, 95{\%} CI 0.88 to 75.48); fewer participants in the sarcosine group experienced adverse events (OR 0.04, 95{\%} CI 0.00 to 0.68; P = 0.03, 1 study, 40 participants). This was based on low quality evidence. No significant results were found for the remaining glutamate receptor modulators. In one study with 18 participants, ketamine was more effective than ECT at 24 hours (OR 28.00, 95{\%} CI 2.07 to 379.25) and 72 hours (OR 12.25, 95{\%} CI 1.33 to 113.06), but not at one week (OR 3.35, 95{\%} CI 0.12 to 93.83), or two weeks (OR 3.35, 95{\%} CI 0.12 to 93.83). No differences in terms of adverse events were found between ketamine and ECT, however the only adverse events reported were blood pressure and heart rate. This study was rated as very low quality. Authors' conclusions We found limited evidence for ketamine's efficacy over placebo at time points up to one week in terms of the primary outcome, response rate. The effects were less certain at two weeks post-treatment. No significant results were found for the remaining ten glutamate receptor modulators, except for sarcosine being more effective than citalopram at four weeks. In terms of adverse events, the only significant differences in favour of placebo over ketamine were in regards to confusion and emotional blunting. Despite the promising nature of these preliminary results, our confidence in the evidence was limited by risk of bias and the small number of participants. Many trials did not provide information on all the prespecified outcomes and we found no data, or very limited data, on very important issues like suicidality, cognition, quality of life, costs to healthcare services and dropouts due to lack of efficacy.},

abstract = {Computational chemistry and other simulation fields are critically dependent on computing resources, but few problems scale efficiently to the hundreds of thousands of processors available in current supercomputersparticularly for molecular dynamics. This has turned into a bottleneck as new hardware generations primarily provide more processing units rather than making individual units much faster, which simulation applications are addressing by increasingly focusing on sampling with algorithms such as free-energy perturbation, Markov state modeling, metadynamics, or milestoning. All these rely on combining results from multiple simulations into a single observation. They are potentially powerful approaches that aim to predict experimental observables directly, but this comes at the expense of added complexity in selecting sampling strategies and keeping track of dozens to thousands of simulations and their dependencies. Here, we describe how the distributed execution framework Copernicus allows the expression of such algorithms in generic workf lows: dataflow programs. Because dataflow algorithms explicitly state dependencies of each constituent part, algorithms only need to be described on conceptual level, after which the execution is maximally parallel. The fully automated execution facilitates the optimization of these algorithms with adaptive sampling, where undersampled regions are automatically detected and targeted without user intervention. We show how several such algorithms can be formulated for computational chemistry problems, and how they are executed efficiently with many loosely coupled simulations using either distributed or parallel resources with Copernicus.},

abstract = {This paper considers communication in terms of inference about the behaviour of others (and our own behaviour). It is based on the premise that our sensations are largely generated by other agents like ourselves. This means, we are trying to infer how our sensations are caused by others, while they are trying to infer our behaviour: for example, in the dialogue between two speakers. We suggest that the infinite regress induced by modelling another agent - who is modelling you - can be finessed if you both possess the same model. In other words, the sensations caused by others and oneself are generated by the same process. This leads to a view of communication based upon a narrative that is shared by agents who are exchanging sensory signals. Crucially, this narrative transcends agency - and simply involves intermittently attending to and attenuating sensory input. Attending to sensations enables the shared narrative to predict the sensations generated by another (i.e. to listen), while attenuating sensory input enables one to articulate the narrative (i.e. to speak). This produces a reciprocal exchange of sensory signals that, formally, induces a generalised synchrony between internal (neuronal) brain states generating predictions in both agents. We develop the arguments behind this perspective, using an active (Bayesian) inference framework and offer some simulations (of birdsong) as proof of principle.},

abstract = {Parents and family members whose adult child or relative has a mental illness endure significant losses, to which they respond with grief. Such grief may negatively affect family members' physical and psychological health and also the relationship with their relative. Yet, research in this field is sparse. Very few studies have examined parents' loss and grief in the context of the patient being a child or teen. It is not clear the extent to which parents' loss and grief in response to their child or adolescent's mental illness is similar or different to the accounts of older parents and family members caring for an adult relative with major psychopathology (e.g., Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder). Parental loss and grief is not often addressed in child and adolescent mental health services' provision of care; alarmingly, little is known about how best to support parents who access these services. The present study aimed to bridge this knowledge gap and identify the therapeutic needs of this younger parent population. Comprehensive interviews were conducted with 14 parents and one custodial grandparent of a youth aged 18 years or younger who was currently attending a child and adolescent mental health service. An inductive thematic analysis identified six themes; parents' narrative of finding out, profound and pervasive loss, complex grief, waning support, the challenges of caregiving and a call for assistance. It can be inferred from these results that youth mental illness can constitute a source of loss and grief for parents. Participants' loss and grief was largely consistent with the experience of families caring for an adult relative with major psychopathology. Opportunities for mental health practitioners to support families' loss and grief were identified. Further studies are needed to enhance understanding of this complex and, to a large extent, ignored familial experience. Results do underscore the importance of clinicians acknowledging parents' loss and grief and working directly with this experience over the course of youths' treatment, perhaps in conjunction with family psychoeducation approaches.},

Results.: Methods that can help include a strong allegiance towards the therapy, anything that increases expectations and hope in participants, making use of the weak spots of randomised trials (risk of bias), small sample sizes and waiting list control groups (but not comparisons with existing interventions).

abstract = {ABSTRACTIn the current article, we review existing models of the etiology of voice hearing. We summarize the argument and evidence that voice hearing is primarily a dissociative process involving critical aspects of self. We propose a complementary perspective on these phenomena that is based on a modern behavioral account of complex behavior known as relational frame theory. This type of approach to voice hearing concerns itself with the functions served for the individual by this voice hearing; the necessary history, such as trauma, that establishes these functions; and the relevant dissociative processes involving self and others. In short, we propose a trauma–dissociation developmental trajectory in which trauma impacts negatively on the development of self through the process of dissociation. Using the relational frame theory concept of relations of perspective taking, our dissociation model purports that trauma gives rise to more coordination than distinction relations between self and others, thus ...},

abstract = {Over the last ten years the basic knowledge of brain structure and function has vastly ex-panded, and its incorporation into the developmental sciences is now allowing for more complex and heuristic models of human infancy. In a continuation of this effort, in this two-part work I integrate current interdisciplinary data from attachment studies on dyadic affective communications, neuroscience on the early developing right brain, psychophysiology on stress systems, and psychiatry on psychopath-ogenesis to provide a deeper understanding of the psychoneurobiological mechanisms that underlie infant mental health. In this article I detail the neurobiology of a secure attachment, an exemplar of adaptive infant mental health, and focus upon the primary caregiver's psychobiological regulation of the infant's maturing limbic system, the brain areas specialized for adapting to a rapidly changing environment. The infant's early developing right hemisphere has deep connections into the limbic and autonomic nervous systems and is dominant for the human stress response, and in this manner the attachment relationship facilitates the expansion of the child's coping capcities. This model suggests that adaptive infant mental health can be fundamentally defined as the earliest expression of flexible strategies for coping with the novelty and stress that is inherent in human interactions. This efficient right brain function is a resilience factor for optimal development over the later stages of the life cycle.

Cognitive theories about the positive symptoms of schizophrenia--hallucinations and delusions--have tended to treat perception and belief formation as distinct processes. However, recent advances in computational neuroscience have led us to consider the unusual perceptual experiences of patients and their sometimes bizarre beliefs as part of the same core abnormality--a disturbance in error-dependent updating of inferences and beliefs about the world. We suggest that it is possible to understand these symptoms in terms of a disturbed hierarchical Bayesian framework, without recourse to separate considerations of experience and belief.},

Functional assertiveness is a new concept of assertiveness that represents a method of appropriate self-expression. Functional assertiveness is defined as interpersonal communication that occurs when a speaker encounters interpersonal problems that should be resolved or has objectives that should be achieved, and the speaker's message is perceived as appropriate by the listener (Mitamura {\&} Tanaka-Matsumi, 2010, 2010c). Five studies were conducted in order to develop the FAS. In Study 1, we generated an item pool for FAS, and in Study 2 we developed the FAS prototype using this item pool. Study 3 examined the factorial validity, concurrent validity, and internal consistency of the FAS. Study 4 examined test–retest reliability of the FAS. Study 5 examined responsiveness on the FAS.

Although many assertiveness instruments have been developed for research and clinical purposes, one common shortcoming is a lack of discriminant validity with regard to aggression.

The goal of the present research was to develop a more sensitive instrument measuring two distinguishable forms of assertiveness: adaptive assertiveness and aggressive assertiveness. We present data validating such a measure, the Adaptive and Aggressive Assertiveness Scales (AAA-S). Participants included two samples of college students and a clinical sample of adults with anxiety disorders. The AAA-S demonstrated good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The aggressive assertiveness scale was associated with various forms of aggression and peer reports of aggressive assertiveness. The adaptive assertiveness scale was associated with competence and peer reports of adaptive assertiveness. Importantly, there were no gender differences in adaptive assertiveness.

abstract = {This article presents an " anxiety-regulating " model of short-term dynamic psychotherapy that uses the behavioral principles of desensitization to treat psychodynamic conflict. In this model, psychodynamic conflict is reinterpreted as an " affect phobia. " In contrast to phobic stimuli that are external (bridges, snakes), intrapsychic phobias occur within us; the phobic stimuli are feelings. Within this framework, behavioral methods of exposure and the prevention of avoidance can be applied to avoided feelings to resolve the psychodynamic conflict. Clients who are afraid of anger, grief, or closeness are exposed to these feelings in imagery in doses they can bear. Defensive avoidance is prevented and the client experiences the conflicted feeling while learning to regulate the associated anxiety, guilt, shame, or pain. A case example with transcripted segments of sessions is presented to illustrate these principles. M y model of short-term " anxiety-regulating " therapy follows psychodynamic principles, but uses the technology of behaviorism and cog-nitive therapy to speed up the treatment process. In short-term dynamic work, we expose the client to feelings they are very frightened to face, so I have begun to think of psychodynamic conflicts as " affect phobias. " To resolve these conflicts with feelings, we help the client face the feelings in small enough doses until the feelings are tolerable to bear. Research has shown that exposure and de-sensitization are the best treatments for phobias, and, in agreement with Wachtel (1977), I have found that psychodynamic uncovering and work-ing through as following basic principles of de-sensitization (slowly exposing the client to the • short-term dynamic psychotherapy • psychotherapy integration • desensitization • exposure • psychodynamic conflict • affect phobia},

Research has revealed that these interventions result in inconsistent effects despite being based on theoretical frameworks. This inconsistency indicates that intervention studies need to be designed to examine directly how and why such interventions bring about change and why they sometimes fail. We argue that intervention studies should include a process evaluation that includes a close examination of the psychological and organizational mechanisms that hinder and facilitate desired intervention outcomes. By drawing on existing intervention literature we present an evidence-based model containing three levels of elements that appear to be crucial in process evaluation. We describe how this model may be applied and developed in future research to identify better the mechanisms that link intervention processes to intervention outcomes.},

abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent, often chronic and disabling psychiatric disorder that is associated with significant adverse health and life consequences. Fortunately, there is compelling evidence that cognitive-behavioral therapies, notably exposure therapies, are effective in reducing PTSD symptomology relative to waiting list and active control conditions. Prolonged exposure is a specific exposure therapy program that is considered a first-line evidence-based treatment for PTSD. Unfortunately, barriers to treatment dissemination prevent the majority of individuals with PTSD from receiving evidence-based treatment. Strategies to increase the availability of treatment and boost the efficiency of exposure therapy are now being examined. {\textcopyright} 2011 Expert Reviews Ltd.},

Twenty patients in the clinical range at pretreatment were identified as either with reliable deterioration or with no reliable change at termination. Interviews at termination and 3-year follow-up were analyzed with grounded theory methodology. Results: ?Spinning One's Wheels? emerged as a core category. The patients described the therapeutic relationship as distanced and artificial. While they saw active components in therapy and their own activities in life as beneficial, therapy itself was experienced as overly focused on problem insight and past history. Conclusions: When the therapist does not contribute to the achievement of the patient's treatment goals?even when the patient gains some benefit?the patient does not fully profit from the therapy.},

abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can have lifelong and dynamic effects on health and wellbeing. Research on the long-term consequences emphasises that, for many patients, TBI should be conceptualised as a chronic health condition. Evidence suggests that functional outcomes after TBI can show improvement or deterioration up to two decades after injury, and rates of all-cause mortality remain elevated for many years. Furthermore, TBI represents a risk factor for a variety of neurological illnesses, including epilepsy, stroke, and neurodegenerative disease. With respect to neurodegeneration after TBI, post-mortem studies on the long-term neuropathology after injury have identified complex persisting and evolving abnormalities best described as polypathology, which includes chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Despite growing awareness of the lifelong consequences of TBI, substantial gaps in research exist. Improvements are therefore needed in understanding chronic pathologies and their implications for survivors of TBI, which could inform long-term health management in this sizeable patient population.},

abstract = {The scientific legacy of Paul MacLean provides important insights into the neural substrate of adaptive social behavior in mammals. Through his research and visionary conceptualizations, current investigators can legitimately study social behavior from a neurobiological perspective. His research and writings provided three important contributions. First, he emphasized the importance of evolution as an organizing principle that shaped both the structure of the nervous system and the adaptive social behavior. Second, by defining the limbic system, he legitimized the biological perspective in the study of emotion. Third, he recognized the important role of the vagal afferents in the regulation of higher brain structures. The paper will focus on the Polyvagal Theory. The Polyvagal Theory is a new conceptualization of the role of vagus and employs several features that MacLean emphasized including the importance of evolution, limbic structures and vagal afferents. The Polyvagal Theory builds on these early findings by MacLean and focuses on the link between phylogenetic changes in the autonomic nervous system and social behavior. By focusing on the phylogenetic changes in the structure of the vagus and the role that the vagus plays in the neural regulation of visceral state, new insights regarding social behavior emerge. Moreover, by articulating the phylogenetically organized hierarchy of neural circuits, insights into benefits of social behavior become evident as do an understanding of the behavioral and physiological features associated with stress and psychiatric disorders. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The evaluation of organizational stress management interventions has proved challenging for researchers and practitioners alike. Traditionally, researcher designed quasi-experiments have been regarded as the method for evaluating such interventions. However, relatively few such studies have been satisfactorily completed in organizations, and many of those that have did not adequately take account of intervention processes. This article presents an approach to evaluation that can help to overcome these problems. Two empirical studies are presented that demonstrate that measurement of the intervention process can be used to adapt and shape the design of the evaluation. In both studies, process evaluation incorporating the measurement of intervention exposure was used to partition participant samples ( into intervention and control groups). This approach has the potential to enable and strengthen quantitative outcome evaluation in situations where controlled quasi-experimentation is not possible.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives People exposed to trauma often experience intrusive thoughts and memories about that event. Research examining people's responses to trauma assumes that people can accurately notice the occurrence of symptoms. However, we know from the broader cognitive literature on ‘mind-wandering' that people are not always aware of their current focus of attention. That lack of awareness has implications for our theoretical and practical understanding of how trauma survivors recover from their experience. In the current study we investigated whether people's meta-cognitive beliefs about controlling trauma-related intrusions influenced the occurrence and meta-awareness of those intrusions. Methods We recruited participants who scored high (strong beliefs) or low (weak beliefs) on beliefs regarding the importance of controlling intrusive thoughts. Participants viewed a trauma film then—during a subsequent reading task—reported any film-related intrusions they noticed. We also intermittently asked half the participants to report what they were thinking at that particular moment, to “catch” intrusions without meta-awareness. Results People are not always aware of their trauma intrusions, and importantly, people with strong beliefs are more likely to notice trauma related intrusions both with and without meta-awareness than people with weak beliefs. Limitations We used an analogue trauma, and focused on a particular metacognitive belief, both of which somewhat limit generalizability. We also cannot definitively rule out demand effects. Conclusions Our data add to existing research showing people may lack meta-awareness of trauma-related thoughts, and suggest that survivors with particular metacognitive characteristics may be more vulnerable to ‘mind-wandering' about trauma without awareness.},

abstract = {Background: Anxiety and depression are prevalent among cardiac rehabilitation patients but pharmacological and psychological treatments have limited effectiveness in this group. Furthermore, psychological interventions have not been systematically integrated into cardiac rehabilitation services despite being a strategic priority for the UK National Health Service. A promising new treatment, metacognitive therapy, may be well-suited to the needs of cardiac rehabilitation patients and has the potential to improve outcomes. It is based on the metacognitive model, which proposes that a thinking style dominated by rumination, worry and threat monitoring maintains emotional distress. Metacognitive therapy is highly effective at reducing this thinking style and alleviating anxiety and depression in mental health settings. This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy for cardiac rehabilitation patients with elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. Methods/Design: The PATHWAY Group-MCT trial is a multicentre, two-arm, single-blind, randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy plus usual cardiac rehabilitation to usual cardiac rehabilitation alone. Cardiac rehabilitation patients (target sample n = 332) with elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will be recruited across five UK National Health Service Trusts. Participants randomised to the intervention arm will receive six weekly sessions of group-based metacognitive therapy delivered by either cardiac rehabilitation professionals or research nurses. The intervention and control groups will both be offered the usual cardiac rehabilitation programme within their Trust. The primary outcome is severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms at 4-month follow-up measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score. Secondary outcomes are severity of anxiety/depression at 12-month follow-up, health-related quality of life, severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms and strength of metacognitive beliefs at 4- and 12-month follow-up. Qualitative interviews will help to develop an account of barriers and enablers to the effectiveness of the intervention. Discussion: This trial will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy in alleviating anxiety and depression in cardiac rehabilitation patients. The therapy, if effective, offers the potential to improve psychological wellbeing and quality of life in this large group of patients. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s).},

Since that time, a substantial amount of research has been conducted to test various hypotheses that this model has engendered. Much of this research can be categorized into three lines of inquiry: (a) whether a relationship between problem solving and distress exists; (b) whether effective problem solving serves to attenuate the deleterious effects of stressful life events that in general increase the likelihood of experiencing psychological distress; and (c) whether training individuals experiencing a variety of psychological problems and disorders is an effective means by which to decrease their pathology and enhance their overall quality of life. This article provides an overview of this literature and especially highlights the flexible nature of problem-solving therapy with regard to targeted problems and populations, clinical treatment goals, and modes of implementation.

abstract = {One major function of our brain is to enable us to behave with respect to socially relevant information. Much research on how the adult human brain processes the social world has shown that there is a network of specific brain areas, also called the social brain, preferentially involved during social cognition. Among the specific brain areas involved in the adult social brain, functional activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), is of special importance for human social cognition and behavior. However, from a developmental perspective, it has long been thought that PFC is functionally silent during infancy (first year of life), and until recently, little was known about the role of PFC in the early development of social cognition. I shall present an emerging body of recent neuroimaging studies with infants that provide evidence that mPFC exhibits functional activation much earlier than previously thought, suggesting that the mPFC is involved in social information processing from early in life. This review will highlight work examining infant mPFC function across a range of social contexts. The reviewed findings will illustrate that the human brain is fundamentally adapted to develop within a social context.},

abstract = {Recent estimates suggest that although a majority of funds in organizational training budgets tend to be allocated to leadership training (Ho, 2016; O'Leonard, 2014), only a small minority of organizations believe their leadership training programs are highly effective (Schwartz, Bersin, {\&} Pelster, 2014), calling into question the effectiveness of current leadership development initiatives. To help address this issue, this meta-analysis estimates the extent to which leadership training is effective and identifies the conditions under which these programs are most effective. In doing so, we estimate the effectiveness of leadership training across four criteria (reactions, learning, transfer, and results; Kirkpatrick, 1959) using only employee data and we examine 15 moderators of training design and delivery to determine which elements are associated with the most effective leadership training interventions. Data from 335 independent samples suggest that leadership training is substantially more effective than previously thought, leading to improvements in reactions (delta = .63), learning (delta = .73), transfer (delta = .82), and results (delta = .72), the strength of these effects differs based on various design, delivery, and implementation characteristics. Moderator analyses support the use of needs analysis, feedback, multiple delivery methods (especially practice), spaced training sessions, a location that is on-site, and face-to-face delivery that is not self-administered. Results also suggest that the content of training, attendance policy, and duration influence the effectiveness of the training program. Practical implications for training development and theoretical implications for leadership and training literatures are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Kleckner et al. use monkey and human data to identify an intrinsic brain system that supports interoception (that is, sensations from within the body) and allostasis (that is, the process by which the brain maintains energy regulation in the body).Large-scale intrinsic brain systems have been identified for exteroceptive senses (such as sight, hearing and touch). We introduce an analogous system for representing sensations from within the body, called interoception, and demonstrate its relation to regulating peripheral systems in the body, called allostasis. Employing the recently introduced Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding (EPIC) model, we used tract-tracing studies of macaque monkeys, followed by two intrinsic functional magnetic resonance imaging samples (N = 280 and N = 270) to evaluate the existence of an intrinsic allostatic–interoceptive system in the human brain. Another sample (N = 41) allowed us to evaluate the convergent validity of the hypothesized allostatic–interoceptive system by showing that individuals with stronger connectivity between system hubs performed better on an implicit index of interoceptive ability related to autonomic fluctuations. Implications include insights for the brain's functional architecture, dissolving the artificial boundary between mind and body, and unifying mental and physical illness.},

abstract = {The purpose of this systematic overview was to determine the most effective mode  and dose of physical activity (PA) for treating major depressive disorder (MDD), and to suggest guidelines and recommendations for clinicians. The selection process consisted of a comprehensive search that was conducted up until April 2014 in the following databases: PsycINFO, Medline, PubMed and Scopus. The inclusion criteria were: (1) a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, (2) complete description of intensity, duration and frequency of the PA, (3) the participants had to be diagnosed with MDD according to Diagnostic Statistical Manual 4 th edition (DSM-IV) or International Classification of Disease tenth Revision (ICD-10) criteria (4) if the controls received any treatment, it had to be specified, (5) published after 1990, (6) consist of aerobic or anaerobic treatment PA, and (7) not be a pilotor preliminary study. A quality assessment of each study was conducted independently by two reviewers; this stringent selection process resulted in 12 reviewed studies. CONCLUSION: individually customized PA, for at least 30 minutes, preferably performed under supervision and with a frequency of at least three times per week is recommended when treating MDD. These recommendations must be viewed in light of the relatively few studies matching the inclusion criteria.},

abstract = {The survival of Bifidobacterium animalis strain DN-173 010 was assessed after its ingestion in a fermented product or in a lyophilised form. Twelve healthy subjects were included in a randomised, open study with 2 parallel groups. The composition and activities of the faecal microbiota were monitored before (10-day baseline step), during (1-week product administration step) and after (10-day follow-up step) the ingestion of 1 of the 2 products. A colony immunoblotting method, fluorescent in situ hybridisation with group-specific DNA probes, and temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis using group-specific primers were carried out to compare survival of B. animalis strain DN-173 010 after ingestion of the 2 products, together with analyses of enzyme activities and faecal metabolites. At the end of the supplementation step, the mean number of B. animalis DN-173 010 quantified by immunodetection in the faeces of 5 of 6 subjects in each treatment group was {\textgreater}/=10(8) colony-forming units/g faeces. These numbers corresponded to an average survival of 22{\%} for the lyophilised form and 20{\%} for the fermented product. At the same step, the PCR temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis profiles showed a double band corresponding to the B. animalis DN-173 010 pattern for 11 subjects. No major modification was observed during the trial in either the dominant members of the faecal microbiota assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridisation or their activities. In conclusion, we show that the lyophilised form of B. animalis DN-173 010 survives transit and could represent a more convenient form to administer for long-term clinical trials.},

The following series of experiments aimed to provide preliminary empirical evidence for this hypothesis by comparing college students' preferences for a solvable laboratory task with responsecontingent reinforcement to a formally similar but unsolvable task, on which equal amounts of reinforcement were presented independent of performance. When asked to choose, participants reliably preferred solvable or neutral tasks over unsolvable tasks according to self-report as well as concurrent and forced-choice behavioral procedures. These studies also aimed to investigate whether individuals preferred the solvable condition because it was positively reinforcing or because avoiding the unsolvable condition was negatively reinforcing. Results are consistent with the theory that making sense may continue despite adverse consequences because of experiential avoidance.},

abstract = {Interoceptive fear conditioning is at the core of contempo-rary behavioral accounts of panic disorder. Yet, to date only one study has attempted to evaluate interoceptive fear conditioning in humans (see Acheson, Forsyth, Prenoveau, {\&} Bouton, 2007). That study used brief (physiologically inert) and longer-duration (panicogenic) inhalations of 20{\%} CO 2 -enriched air as an interoceptive conditioned (CS) and unconditioned (US) stimulus and evaluated fear learning in three conditions: CS only, CS–US paired, and CS–US unpaired. Results showed fear conditioning in the paired condition, and fearful responding and resistance to extinc-tion in an unpaired condition. The authors speculated that such effects may be due to difficulty discriminating between the CS and the US. The aims of the present study are to (a) replicate and expand this line of work using an improved methodology, and (b) clarify the role of CS–US discrimina-tion difficulties in either potentiating or depotentiating fear learning. Healthy participants (N = 104) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (a) CS only, (b) contingent CS–US pairings, (c) unpaired CS and US presentations, or (d) an unpaired " discrimination " contingency, which included an exteroceptive discrimination cue concurrently with CS onset. Electrodermal and self-report ratings served as indices of conditioned responding. Consistent with expectation, the paired contingency and unpaired contingencies yielded elevated fearful responding to the CS alone. Moreover, adding a discrimination cue to the unpaired contingency effectively attenuated fearful responding. Overall, findings are consistent with modern learning theory accounts of panic and highlight the role of interoceptive conditioning and unpredictability in the etiology of panic disorder.},

The need to integrate interventions into daily organizational practices, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful implementation and sustainable changes, has also been highlighted. We propose an evaluation model—the Dy-namic Integrated Evaluation Model (DIEM)—that takes this into consideration. In the model, evaluation is fitted into a co-created iterative intervention process, in which the intervention activities can be continuously adapted based on collected data. By explicitly integrating process and context factors, DIEM also considers the dynamic sus-tainability of the intervention over time. It emphasizes the practical value of these evaluations for organizations, as well as the importance of their rigorousness for research purposes.},

Achievement (a component of the Conscientiousness dimension) predicted ratings (r = .25) and objective sales (r = .41). General cognitive ability showed a correlation of .40 with ratings but only .04 with objective sales. Similarly, age predicted ratings (r = .26) but not objective sales (r = —.06). On the basis of a small number of studies, interest appears to be a promising predictor of sales success.},

A substantial body of research indicates that assertiveness is a relevant factor associated with a variety of clinical problems, populations and contexts, and that assertiveness training is a valuable transdiagnostic intervention. Despite its demonstrated importance, research on assertiveness and assertiveness training as a stand-alone treatment within clinical psychology has diminished drastically. We review the history of assertiveness training, early research evidence for assertiveness training in treating various clinical problems, discuss the current status of assertiveness training, issues of clinical implementation, and comment on how the variables accounting for unassertiveness map onto the NIMH RDoC funding priorities.},

abstract = {We expand upon our proposal that the oscillatory interference mechanism proposed for the phase precession effect in place cells underlies the grid-like firing pattern of dorsomedial entorhinal grid cells (O'Keefe and Burgess (2005) Hippocampus 15:853-866). The original one-dimensional interference model is generalized to an appropriate two-dimensional mechanism. Specifically, dendritic subunits of layer II medial entorhinal stellate cells provide multiple linear interference patterns along different directions, with their product determining the firing of the cell. Connection of appropriate speed- and direction- dependent inputs onto dendritic subunits could result from an unsupervised learning rule which maximizes postsynaptic firing (e.g. competitive learning). These inputs cause the intrinsic oscillation of subunit membrane potential to increase above theta frequency by an amount proportional to the animal's speed of running in the "preferred" direction. The phase difference between this oscillation and a somatic input at theta-frequency essentially integrates velocity so that the interference of the two oscillations reflects distance traveled in the preferred direction. The overall grid pattern is maintained in environmental location by phase reset of the grid cell by place cells receiving sensory input from the environment, and environmental boundaries in particular. We also outline possible variations on the basic model, including the generation of grid-like firing via the interaction of multiple cells rather than via multiple dendritic subunits. Predictions of the interference model are given for the frequency composition of EEG power spectra and temporal autocorrelograms of grid cell firing as functions of the speed and direction of running and the novelty of the environment.

abstract = {Background This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of a preventive intervention for anxiety disorders and depression by targeting excessive levels of repetitive negative thinking (RNT; worry and rumination) in adolescents and young adults. Methods Participants (N = 251, 83.7{\%} female) showing elevated levels of RNT were randomly allocated to a 6-week cognitive-behavioral training delivered in a group, via the internet, or to a waitlist control condition. Self-report measures were collected at pre-intervention, post-intervention, 3 m and 12 m follow-up. Results Both versions of the preventive intervention significantly reduced RNT (d = 0.53 to 0.89), and symptom levels of anxiety and depression (d = 0.36 to 0.72). Effects were maintained until 12 m follow-up. The interventions resulted in a significantly lower 12 m prevalence rate of depression (group intervention: 15.3{\%}, internet intervention: 14.7{\%}) and generalized anxiety disorder (group intervention: 18.0{\%}, internet intervention: 16.0{\%}), compared to the waitlist (32.4{\%} and 42.2{\%}, respectively). Mediation analyses demonstrated that reductions in RNT mediated the effect of the interventions on the prevalence of depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Conclusions Results provide evidence for the efficacy of this preventive intervention targeting RNT and support a selective prevention approach that specifically targets a known risk factor to prevent multiple disorders.},

abstract = {We present the initial results of a reanalysis of four articles from the Cornell Food and Brand Lab based on data collected from diners at an Italian restaurant buffet. On a first glance at these articles, we immediately noticed a number of apparent inconsistencies in the summary statistics. A thorough reading of the articles and careful reanalysis of the results revealed additional problems. The sample sizes for the number of diners in each condition are incongruous both within and between the four articles. In some cases, the degrees of freedom of between-participant test statistics are larger than the sample size, which is impossible. Many of the computed F and t statistics are inconsistent with the reported means and standard deviations. In some cases, the number of possible inconsistencies for a single statistic was such that we were unable to determine which of the components of that statistic were incorrect. We contacted the authors of the four articles, but they have thus far not agreed to share their data. The attached Appendix reports approximately 150 inconsistencies in these four articles, which we were able to identify from the reported statistics alone. We hope that our analysis will encourage readers, using and extending the simple methods that we describe, to undertake their own efforts to verify published results, and that such initiatives will improve the accuracy and reproducibility of the scientific literature.},

abstract = {Health Psychologists using questionnaires rely heavily on Cronbach's alpha as indicator of scale reliability and internal consistency. Cronbach's alpha is often viewed as some kind of quality label: high values certify scale quality, low values prompt removal of one or several items. Unfortunately, this approach suffers two fundamental problems. First, Cronbach's alpha is both unrelated to a scale's internal consistency and a fatally flawed estimate of its reliability. Second, the approach itself assumes that scale items are repeated measurements, an assumption that is often violated and rarely desirable. The problems with Cronbach's alpha are easily solved by computing readily available alternatives, such as the Greatest Lower Bound or Omega. Solving the second problem, however, is less straightforward. This requires foregoing the appealing comfort of a quantitative, seemingly objective indicator of scale quality altogether, instead acknowledging the relationship between reliability and validity and the distinction between scales and indices. In this contribution, I will explore these issues, and provide recommendations for scale inspection that takes these dynamics into account.},

Intra- and intergroup processes, not dyadic rela- tionships, are responsible for the transmission of culture and for environmental modification of children's personality characteristics.

abstract = {A cognitive map has long been the dominant metaphor for hippocampal function, embracing the idea that place cells encode a geometric representation of space. However, evidence for predictive coding, reward sensitivity, and policy dependence in place cells suggests that the representation is not purely spatial. We approach this puzzle from a reinforcement learning perspective: what kind of spatial representation is most useful for maximizing future reward? We show that the answer takes the form of a predictive representation. This representation captures many aspects of place cell responses that fall outside the traditional view of a cognitive map. Furthermore, we argue that entorhinal grid cells encode a low-dimensional basis set for the predictive representation, useful for suppressing noise in predictions and extracting multiscale structure for hierarchical planning.},

It aims to reduce worry and rumination and alter problematic patterns of attention and coping. In doing so it targets underlying metacognition that controls thinking and helps patients develop new ways of consciously experiencing inner events. Data from treatment studies suggest that individual MCT techniques and full treatment are highly effective. Further randomized trials are clearly warranted.},

abstract = {Predictive coding theory (Srinivasan et al., 1982; Mumford, 1992; Rao and Ballard, 1999) claims that the function of the hierarchical organization in the cortex is to reconcile representations and predictions of sensory input at multiple levels. It does this because the dynamics of neural activity is geared toward minimizing the error: the difference between the input representation at each level and the prediction originating from a higher level representation. In other words, the neural activities in the whole hierarchy settle to a state where the difference between the prediction and the representation of sensory input is minimal. This view has gained enormous popularity, and research applying this theoretical framework to explain various kinds of empirical data has flourished since then (Friston, 2010; Clark, 2013b).},

A list of FAQs (frequently asked questions) can be found at the end of this chapter. For those who are unfamiliar with the concepts involved with HEG, reading the FAQs first may make the rest of the chapter easier to understand. The training of body functions to achieve restoration to health is now broadly accessible through complex instrumentation which is capable of capturing a variety of body responses. The term biofeedback refers to the process of “feeding back” physiological signals non-invasively from externally reached areas of the body. The feedback has the intent of teaching control over these signals. It has a long and respected history of assisting people in the management of troublesome physiological and emotional conditions. The term neurofeedback is a distinctive subset of biofeedback. It makes use of physiological signals that originate within the brain, as opposed to signals that originate from other sites such as cardiac or skeletal muscle activity. Neurofeedback includes both electroencephalography (EEG) and hemoencephalography (HEG) feedback.},

The paper then introduces the more flexible JD-R model and discusses its basic premises. Findings – The paper provides an overview of the studies that have been conducted with the JD-R model. It discusses evidence for each of the model's main propositions. The JD-R model can be used as a tool for human resource management. A two-stage approach can highlight the strengths and weaknesses of individuals, work groups, departments, and organizations at large. Originality/value – This paper challenges existing stress models, and focuses on both negative and positive indicators of employee well being. In addition, it outlines how the JD-R model can be applied to a wide range of occupations, and be used to improve employee well being and performance.

Abstract: The potential complementarity of an evolving developmental contextualist paradigm and community psychology is explored through an overview of 5 areas of research and intervention in community psychology: (a) models for understanding the social context and people in context; (b) sociocultural influences on person-environment transactions; (c) research methods designed to investigate in vivo, multilevel relations between people and contexts; (d) empowerment as a guide for developing research relationships; and (e) ethical issues in community research and intervention. The overview is intended to provide a basis for increased discussion and collaboration across disciplinary boundaries. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] (AN: 18278190)},

abstract = {Prevention of depression and anxiety disorders is widely acknowledged as an important health care investment. However, existing preventive interventions have only shown modest effects. In order to improve the efficacy of prevention of depression and anxiety disorders, a number of authors have suggested that it is promising to focus on selective prevention programs that are offered to individuals scoring high on clearly established risk factors, whereby the preventive intervention then specifically targets these risk variables. This review presents repetitive negative thinking (worry and rumination) as a promising target for the prevention of depression and anxiety disorders. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The present study investigated perceived acceptability and suppression of negative emotion in participants with anxiety and mood disorders. Sixty participants with these disorders and 30 control participants watched an emotion-provoking film and completed self-report measures of their experience and regulation of emotions. The film elicited similar increases in negative emotion for clinical and nonclinical participants; however, clinical participants judged their resulting emotions as less acceptable and suppressed their emotions to a greater extent. The higher level of suppression in the clinical group was attributable to females in the clinical group suppressing their emotions more than females in the nonclinical group. For all participants, high levels of suppression were associated with increased negative emotion during the film and during a postfilm recovery period. Further analyses showed that appraising emotions as unacceptable mediated the relationship between negative emotion intensity and use of suppression in the clinical group. This study extends the literature on emotion regulation to a clinical sample and suggests that judging emotions as unacceptable and suppressing emotions may be important aspects of the phenomenology of emotional disorders.},

LFB, 0000-0003-4478-2051 In this paper, we integrate recent theoretical and empirical developments in predictive coding and active inference accounts of interoception (including the Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding model) with working hypoth-eses from the theory of constructed emotion to propose a biologically plausible unified theory of the mind that places metabolism and energy regulation (i.e. allostasis), as well as the sensory consequences of that regulation (i.e. inter-oception), at its core. We then consider the implications of this approach for understanding depression. We speculate that depression is a disorder of allos-tasis, whose myriad symptoms result from a 'locked in' brain that is relatively insensitive to its sensory context. We conclude with a brief discussion of the ways our approach might reveal new insights for the treatment of depression.

abstract = {Recent work on the extinction of fear-motivated learning places emphasis on its putative circuitry and on its modulation. Extinction is the learned inhibition of retrieval of previously acquired responses. Fear extinction is used as a major component of exposure therapy in the treatment of fear memories such as those of the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is initiated and maintained by interactions between the hippocampus, basolateral amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which involve feedback regulation of the latter by the other two areas. Fear extinction depends on NMDA receptor activation. It is positively modulated by d-serine acting on the glycine site of NMDA receptors and blocked by AP5 (2-amino-5-phosphono propionate) in the three structures. In addition, histamine acting on H2 receptors and endocannabinoids acting on CB1 receptors in the three brain areas mentioned, and muscarinic cholinergic fibers from the medial septum to hippocampal CA1 positively modulate fear extinction. Importantly, fear extinction can be made state-dependent on circulating epinephrine, which may play a role in situations of stress. Exposure to a novel experience can strongly enhance the consolidation of fear extinction through a synaptic tagging and capture mechanism; this may be useful in the therapy of states caused by fear memory like PTSD.},

This point cannot be overemphasized enough, nor restated in various ways enough.

Heat is not a binary digit. A telegraph operator is not a Maxwell's demon. The statistical theory of radiography and electrical signal transmission is NOT gas theory. The equations used in communication theory have absolutely nothing to do with the equations used in thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, or statistical thermodynamics.

@article{Kanfer2017,
abstract = {We present here a review of observations and the current theories that attempt to explain coronal EIT waves. EIT waves were first observed by SOHO-EIT in 1996. Since then, careful analysis has shown that they are related to various other phenomena, such as: CMEs, coronal dimming regions, Moreton waves, and transverse coronal loop oscillations. Over the years, myriad theories have been proposed to explain EIT waves. Early attempts, while elegant, relied heavily on theories based on pre-coronal observations. More recent work, which tends to consider a larger data pool, has led to two competing theoretical camps: wave vs. non-wave models; in many cases, proposed hypotheses flatly contradict each other. Sifting through these seemingly-incongruous models requires a thorough understanding of the available data, as some observations make certain theories more difficult to justify. However, some questions still do not appear resolvable with current data and will likely require help from the next generation of coronal telescopes.},

Perceptions of social isolation, or loneliness, increase vigilance for threat and heighten feelings of vulnerability while also raising the desire to reconnect. Implicit hypervigilance for social threat alters psychological processes that influence physiological functioning, diminish sleep quality, and increase morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this paper is to review the features and consequences of loneliness within a comprehensive theoretical framework that informs interventions to reduce loneliness. We review physical and mental health consequences of loneliness, mechanisms for its effects, and effectiveness of extant interventions. Features of a loneliness regulatory loop are employed to explain cognitive, behavioral, and physiological consequences of loneliness and to discuss interventions to reduce loneliness. Loneliness is not simply being alone. Interventions to reduce loneliness and its health consequences may need to take into account its attentional, confirmatory, and memorial biases as well as its social and behavioral effects.},

abstract = {The retrieval or reactivation of a memory places it into a labile state, requiring a process of reconsolidation to restabilize it. This retrieval-induced plasticity is a potential mechanism for the modification of the existing memory. Following previous data supportive of a functional role for memory reconsolidation in the modification of memory strength, here I show that hippocampal memory reconsolidation also supports the updating of contextual memory content. Using a procedure that separates the learning of pure context from footshock-motivated contextual fear learning, I demonstrate doubly dissociable hippocampal mechanisms of initial context learning and subsequent updating of the neutral contextual representation to incorporate the footshock. Contextual memory consolidation was dependent upon BDNF expression in the dorsal hippocampus, whereas the footshock modification of the contextual representation required the expression of Zif268. These mechanisms match those previously shown to be selectively involved in hippocampal memory consolidation and reconsolidation, respectively. Moreover, memory reactivation is a necessary step in modifying memory content, as inhibition of hippocampal synaptic protein degradation also prevented the footshock-mediated memory modification. Finally, dorsal hippocampal knockdown of Zif268 impaired the reconsolidation of the pure contextual memory only under conditions of weak context memory training, as well as failing to disrupt contextual freezing when a strong contextual fear memory is reactivated by further conditioning. Therefore, an adaptive function of the reactivation and reconsolidation process is to enable the updating of memory content.},

(a) The fear module is preferentially activated in aversive contexts by stimuli that are fear relevant in an evolutionary perspective. (b) Its activation to such stimuli is automatic. (c) It is relatively impenetrable to cognitive control. (d) It originates in a dedicated neural circuitry, centered on the amygdala.

abstract = {Employees face a variety of work demands that place a premium on personal attributes, such as the degree to which they can be depended on to work independently, deal with stress, and interact positively with coworkers and customers. We examine evidence for the importance of these personality attributes using research strategies intended to answer three fundamental questions, including (a) how well does employees' standing on these attributes predict job performance?, (b) what types of attributes do employers seek to evaluate in interviews when considering applicants?, and (c) what types of attributes are rated as important for performance in a broad sampling of occupations across the U.S. economy? We summarize and integrate results from these three strategies using the Big Five personality dimensions as our organizing framework. Our findings indicate that personal attributes related to Conscientiousness and Agreeableness are important for success across many jobs, spanning across low to high levels of job complexity, training, and experience necessary to qualify for employment. The strategies lead to differing conclusions about the relative importance of Emotional Stability and Extraversion. We note implications for job seekers, for interventions aimed at changing standing on these attributes, and for employers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The most efficacious treatments for social anxiety disorder (SAD) are the SSRIs and cognitive therapy (CT). Combined treatment is advocated for SAD but has not been evaluated in randomized trials using CT and SSRI. Our aim was to evaluate whether one treatment is more effective than the other and whether combined treatment is more effective than the single treatments. METHODS A total of 102 patients were randomly assigned to paroxetine, CT, the combination of CT and paroxetine, or pill placebo. The medication treatment lasted 26 weeks. Of the 102 patients, 54{\%} fulfilled the criteria for an additional diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder. Outcomes were measured at posttreatment and 12-month follow-up assessments. RESULTS CT was superior to paroxetine alone and to pill placebo at the end of treatment, but it was not superior to the combination treatment. At the 12-month follow-up, the CT group maintained benefits and was significantly better than placebo and paroxetine alone, whereas there were no significant differences among combination treatment, paroxetine alone, and placebo. Recovery rates at 12 months were much higher in the CT group (68{\%}) compared to 40{\%} in the combination group, 24{\%} in the paroxetine group, and 4{\%} in the pill placebo group. CONCLUSIONS CT was the most effective treatment for SAD at both posttreatment and follow-up compared to paroxetine and better than combined treatment at the 12-month follow-up on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Combined treatment provided no advantage over single treatments; rather there was less effect of the combined treatment compared to CT alone.},

@article{Haeffel,
abstract = {a b s t r a c t A randomized trial was conducted to test the efficacy of three self-directed prevention intervention workbooks for depression. Cognitively at-risk college freshmen were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: traditional cognitive, non-traditional cognitive, and academic skills. Consistent with hypotheses, participants who were high in rumination and experienced stress exhibited significantly greater levels of depressive symptoms after completing the traditional cognitive skills workbook than after completing the other two workbooks. This pattern of results held post-intervention and 4 months later. These findings indicate that rumination may hinder ones ability to identify and dispute negative thoughts (at least without the help of a trained professional). The results underscore the importance of identifying individual difference variables that moderate intervention efficacy. They also raise concerns about the potential benefits of self-help books, an industry that generates billions of dollars each year. Cognitive interventions are among the most effective inter-ventions for depression. These interventions are based on the idea that some people develop depression because they have a tendency to generate negative interpretations of stressful life events (e.g., Beck, Rush, Shaw, {\&} Emery, 1979). Thus, a central goal of cogni-tively-based interventions is to teach people to identify negative cognitions, evaluate them, and then generate more adaptive cognitions. Research indicates that cognitive therapy (and related cognitive behavioral therapies) is as effective as medication, has no side effects, and may even have a relapse prevention effect (Hollon, Thase, {\&} Markowitz, 2002). Like most mental health resources, cognitive interventions have focused largely on treatment. Treatment interventions occur after the onset of the disorder and focus on bringing the clinical episode to an end. Although treatment interventions bring much needed relief to those who are suffering, they rarely eradicate a disorder (Albee, 1985). In order to eradicate a disorder, it is necessary to prevent the disorder from occurring in the first place. To this end, depression researchers have begun to create and test prevention interventions. Results from these initial prevention studies have been prom-ising. They indicate that high-risk individuals are less likely to develop depression after receiving a cognitively-based intervention than after receiving a control intervention (e.g., Horowitz {\&} Garber, 2006). However, the research to date has two major limitations. First, most interventions have been time intensive (e.g., {\textgreater}12 sessions) and have required trained professionals. These charac-teristics make dissemination to the general public difficult. Ideally, prevention interventions should be cost effective, highly accessible, and self-directed. Second, previous studies have not identified which individuals are likely to benefit from a cognitive prevention intervention. This is an important limitation because approxi-mately half of participants do not respond to cognitive interven-tions (Hollon et al., 2002; Horowitz {\&} Garber, 2006). In light of these limitations, the goal of the current study was to: (a) create and test a cognitive prevention intervention that could be easily disseminated to the general public, and (b) identify moder-ators of intervention efficacy. To this end, the current study tested a cognitive prevention intervention that uses workbooks. Work-books were chosen because they are cost-efficient, portable, highly accessible, and can be used without the help of a therapist. We also identified two potential moderators of intervention efficacy to examine – stress and rumination. It is necessary to measure life stress when evaluating the efficacy of cognitive interventions because the cognitive theories of depression specify a vulnerability-stress model. According to this model, the effectiveness of a prevention intervention (assuming the vulnerability was reduced) should only emerge in the presence of stressful life events. Similarly, rumination also has the potential to moderate interven-tion efficacy. Rumination is the maladaptive tendency to},

abstract = { Background. The clinician-administered version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS-CA) is a commonly used assessment device for the evaluation of social anxiety disorder and has been shown to have strong psychometric characteristics. Because of its apparently straightforward rating format and potential savings in time and effort, interest in the use of the LSAS as a self-report (LSAS-SR) measure has increased, and the LSAS-SR has been used in a number of studies. However, the psychometric properties of the LSAS-SR have not been well established.  Methods. This study examined the psychometric properties of the LSAS-SR in comparison to the LSAS-CA in a sample of 99 individuals with a primary diagnosis of social anxiety disorder and 53 individuals with no current psychiatric disorder.  Results. There was little difference between the two versions of the LSAS on any scale or subscale score. Both forms were internally consistent and the subscale intercorrelations for the two forms were essentially identical. Correlations of each LSAS-SR index with its LSAS-CA counterpart were all highly significant. Finally, the convergent and discriminant validity of the two forms of the LSAS was shown to be strong.  Conclusion. Results of this study suggest that the self-report version of the LSAS compares well to the clinician-administered version and may be validly employed in the assessment of social anxiety disorder. },

Third, the fear module is relatively impenetrable to conscious cognitive control, and fear conditioning with fear-relevant stimuli can occur even with subliminal conditioned stimuli. Fourth, the amygdala seems to be the central brain area dedicated to the fear module.

abstract = {The retrieval of a memory places it into a plastic state, the result of which is that the memory can be disrupted or even enhanced by experimental treatment. This phenomenon has been conceptualised within a frame-work of memories being reactivated and then reconso-lidated in repeated rounds of cellular processing. The reconsolidation phase has been seized upon as crucial for the understanding of memory stability and, more recently, as a potential therapeutic target in the treat-ment of disorders such as post-traumatic stress and drug addiction. However, little is known about the reactiva-tion process, or what might be the adaptive function of retrieval-induced plasticity. Reconsolidation has long been proposed to mediate memory updating, but only recently has this hypothesis been supported experimen-tally. Here, the adaptive function of memory reconsoli-dation is explored in more detail, with a strong emphasis on its role in updating memories to maintain their relevance. Introduction An introspective analysis of memory clearly suggests that human memories are neither constant in content nor of fixed strength. Memory retrieval is often triggered by a similar experience that subsequently intermeshes with and modifies future recollections. The reconstructive nature of memory retrieval and memory malleability in general is recognized within the domains of cognitive psychology and neuroscience [1,2]. However, this cognitive level of analysis is not immediately reconciled with the molecular neurobiological understanding of learning and memory. The interest generated by the study of synaptic plasticity in both hippocampal slices and simpler invert-ebrate models has led to a surge in knowledge at the cellular level. Whereas mammalian behavioural studies are equally plentiful, the neurobiological analysis has largely been conducted within the theoretical framework of memory consolidation and the time-dependent stabiliz-ation of plasticity [3], an implicit assumption of which is that memories are subsequently stable and fixed. The phenomenon of 'memory reconsolidation' [4] has the potential to bridge the divide between cellular and cogni-tive accounts of long-term memory. I will not provide a comprehensive review of the extensive literature on the cellular and behavioural mechanisms of memory reconso-lidation (reviews of this nature are relatively plentiful, e.g. Refs [5–10]). Instead, I will focus on a particular viewpoint, namely that reconsolidation serves to enable the updating of memories, ultimately to maintain their predictive and adaptive relevance. Therefore, it is important to note that reconsolidation does not simply represent an automatic restabilization of a retrieved memory, but is a special process that presents an opportunity for adaptive modifi-cation. Moreover, the numerous negative findings in relation to reconsolidation can be argued to result from the use of experimental conditions that fail to engage a memory updating process (thereby explaining the exist-ence of boundary conditions on memory reconsolidation). Given the emphasis on normal learning and memory pro-cesses, it is also possible to integrate ideas on reconsolida-tion and memory updating with traditional learning theories, and I will focus on the potential role of surprise and prediction error. Finally, I will conclude with the broad implications of a memory updating hypothesis of reconso-lidation, both in terms of how reconsolidation itself might be viewed as an epiphenomenon, and the conclusion that experimental amnesia must reflect storage impairments.},

abstract = {Valued personal objects reflect important identity elements. Such possessions may provide individuals with a sense of identity continuity, especially during periods of major life transitions. This qualitative study explores the symbolic meanings and functions of cherished objects for identity maintenance and revision processes among late-life adults following their transition into a supervised living facility. Twenty individuals, 8 men and 12 women, aged 65 to 89 participated. Nine lived in independent units and 11 in single rooms on the grounds of a residential facility for older adults in one of two New Zealand cities. All had moved to the facilities within the previous 18 months. A semistructured interview that focused on participants' life histories and cherished possessions was administered. Grounded theory methods were used to identify symbolic meanings and functions of valued personal objects. Among important identity functions were symbolic links to important relationships, to past personal and historical events, and to the self in previous life phases. Theory and research on late adulthood has pointed to important symbolic mean-ings that valued personal objects may play in identity terms. Rochberg-Halton (1984), for example, suggested that valued objects hold an important role through-out the life span: " Valued material possessions {\ldots} act as signs of the self that are es-sential in their own right for its continued cultivation, and hence the world of},

According to this perspective, delusional beliefs, as well as their emergence and persistence, stem from an interplay between (dysfunctional) mental representations and processes. Our paper aims to provide a starting point for researchers and clinicians interested in examining the topic of delusions from a functional-analytic perspective. We begin with a brief review of the research literature with a particular focus on persecutory delusions. Thereafter we introduce Contextual Behavioral Science (CBS), Relational Frame Theory (RFT) and a behavioral phenomenon known as arbitrarily applicable relational responding (AARR). Drawing upon AARR, and recent empirical developments within CBS, we argue that (persecutory) delusions may be conceptualized, studied and influenced using a functional-analytic approach. We consider future directions for research in this area as well as clinical interventions aimed at influencing delusions and their expression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heightened reactivity to unpredictable threat (U-threat) is a core individual difference factor underlying fear-based psychopathology. Little is known, however, about whether reactivity to U-threat is a stable marker of fear-based psychopathology or if it is malleable to treatment. The aim of the current study was to address this question by examining differences in reactivity to U-threat within patients before and after 12-weeks of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). METHODS: Participants included patients with principal fear (n = 22) and distress/misery disorders (n = 29), and a group of healthy controls (n = 21) assessed 12-weeks apart. A well-validated threat-of-shock task was used to probe reactivity to predictable (P-) and U-threat and startle eyeblink magnitude was recorded as an index of defensive responding. RESULTS: Across both assessments, individuals with fear-based disorders displayed greater startle magnitude to U-threat relative to healthy controls and distress/misery patients (who did not differ). From pre- to post-treatment, startle magnitude during U-threat decreased only within the fear patients who received CBT. Moreover, within fear patients, the magnitude of decline in startle to U-threat correlated with the magnitude of decline in fear symptoms. For the healthy controls, startle to U-threat across the two time points was highly reliable and stable. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results indicate that startle to U-threat characterizes fear disorder patients and is malleable to treatment with CBT but not SSRIs within fear patients. Startle to U-threat may therefore reflect an objective, psychophysiological indicator of fear disorder status and CBT treatment response.},

abstract = {Objective: Effective treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) exist, but additional treatment options are needed. The effectiveness of 8 sessions of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for adult OCD was compared with progressive relaxation training (PRT). Method: Seventy-nine adults (61{\%} female) diagnosed with OCD (mean age ϭ 37 years; 89{\%} Caucasian) participated in a randomized clinical trial of 8 sessions of ACT or PRT with no in-session exposure. The following assessments were completed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up by an assessor who was unaware of treatment conditions: Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Beck Depression Inventory–II, Quality of Life Scale, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, Thought Action Fusion Scale, and Thought Control Questionnaire. Treatment Evaluation Inventory was completed at posttreatment. Results: ACT produced greater changes at posttreatment and follow-up over PRT on OCD severity (Y-BOCS: ACT pretreatment ϭ 24.22, posttreat-ment ϭ 12.76, follow-up ϭ 11.79; PRT pretreatment ϭ 25.4, posttreatment ϭ 18.67, follow-up ϭ 16.23) and produced greater change on depression among those reporting at least mild depression before treatment. Clinically significant change in OCD severity occurred more in the ACT condition than PRT (clinical response rates: ACT posttreatment ϭ 46{\%}–56{\%}, follow-up ϭ 46{\%}– 66{\%}; PRT posttreatment ϭ 13{\%}–18{\%}, follow-up ϭ 16{\%}–18{\%}). Quality of life improved in both conditions but was marginally in favor of ACT at posttreatment. Treatment refusal (2.4{\%} ACT, 7.8{\%} PRT) and dropout (9.8{\%} ACT, 13.2{\%} PRT) were low in both conditions. Conclusions: ACT is worth exploring as a treatment for OCD.},

Genom exempel p{\aa} konkreta personalekonomiska ber{\"{a}}kningar p{\aa}visas vikten av att beakta validiteten i de test och metoder man anv{\"{a}}nder, hur man ska resonera n{\"{a}}r man v{\"{a}}ljer kombinationer av metoder, och i vilka situationer ett valitt urvalsf{\"{o}}rfarande har st{\"{o}}rst ekonomisk betydelse. Rekrytering Innan en diskussion om effekterna av graden av validitet i urvalsmetoder kan f{\"{o}}ras, b{\"{o}}r n{\aa}gra andra personalrelaterade begrepp belysas ur olika perspektiv, d{\aa} de har stora ekonomiska konsekvenser. Ett urval f{\"{o}}reg{\aa}s i allm{\"{a}}nhet av n{\aa}gon form av rekryterings-56 process, det vill s{\"{a}}ga de strategier och metoder man anv{\"{a}}nder f{\"{o}}r att v{\"{a}}rva s{\"{o}}kande till de aktuella tj{\"{a}}nsterna (ofta anv{\"{a}}nds rekrytering och urval synonymt, men {\"{a}}r egentligen tv{\aa} delar av det f{\"{o}}rfarande som syftar till att anst{\"{a}}lla ny personal). Det finns m{\aa}nga olika s{\"{a}}tt att rekrytera kandidater, och vilket som l{\"{a}}mpar sig b{\"{a}}st varierar med typen av arbete eller tj{\"{a}}nst. N{\"{a}}r man ska tills{\"{a}}tta komplexa befattningar, som till exempel en tj{\"{a}}nst som vd vid ett stort eller mellanstort f{\"{o}}retag, {\"{a}}r de formella kraven f{\"{o}}rmodligen t{\"{a}}mligen h{\"{o}}ga och v{\"{a}}lspecificerade. I s{\aa}dana fall kanske en searchkonsult {\"{a}}r det b{\"{a}}sta alternativet, speciellt om man vill vara diskret i sin rekrytering av den nya vd:n – en annons i dagspressen framst{\aa}r m{\aa}h{\"{a}}nda inte som ett aktuellt alternativ. Searchkonsulten kan d{\aa} anv{\"{a}}nda sitt n{\"{a}}tverk f{\"{o}}r att s{\"{o}}ka efter m{\"{o}}jliga kandidater och sedan presentera n{\aa}gra som f{\"{o}}retaget f{\aa}r v{\"{a}}lja mellan. F{\"{o}}rdelarna med denna metod {\"{a}}r diskretionen, tidsaspekten (att annonsera, inv{\"{a}}nta ans{\"{o}}kningar, granska dessa och s{\aa} vidare kan ta l{\aa}ng tid), och att den generar h{\"{o}}g s{\aa} kallad baskvot. Detta personal-ekonomiska begrepp anger den andel av de s{\"{o}}kande (oftast uttryckt i procent) som skulle bli framg{\aa}ngsrika medarbetare {\"{a}}ven om man inte till{\"{a}}mpade n{\aa}gon urvalsmetod alls. Baskvoten {\"{a}}r en teoretisk uppskattning som kan variera mellan branscher, konjunkturer, olika yrken och framf{\"{o}}r allt mellan olika rekryteringsf{\"{o}}rfaranden. I fallet med vd:n, d{\"{a}}r de formella kraven {\"{a}}r h{\"{o}}gt st{\"{a}}llda och en searchkonsult utifr{\aa}n sitt n{\"{a}}tverk identifierar l{\"{a}}mpliga kandidater, f{\aa}r man troligen en h{\"{o}}g baskvot – de kandidater som presenteras h{\aa}ller f{\"{o}}rmodligen mycket h{\"{o}}g kvalitet. Det finns emellertid {\"{a}}ven nackdelar med att anlita en searchkonsult; den allvarligaste {\"{a}}r f{\"{o}}rmodligen att f{\"{o}}retaget {\"{a}}r helt utl{\"{a}}mnat till konsultens n{\"{a}}tverk och d{\"{a}}rmed riskerar att g{\aa} miste om andra duktiga kandidater. Den ekonomiska aspekten p{\aa} denna typ av urvalsf{\"{o}}rfarande {\"{a}}r ocks{\aa} viktig. En searchkonsults arvode uppg{\aa}r i regel till cirka 35 {\%} av {\aa}rsl{\"{o}}nen f{\"{o}}r befattningen ifr{\aa}ga, och eftersom det n{\"{a}}stan uteslutande {\"{a}}r befattningar med h{\"{o}}ga l{\"{o}}ner som {\"{a}}r aktuella f{\"{o}}r den h{\"{a}}r typen av rekrytering, kan ett arvode uppg{\aa} till en kvarts miljon kronor. Detta kan leda till en viss selektiv varseblivning hos searchkonsulten n{\"{a}}r f{\"{o}}rtj{\"{a}}nster och brister bed{\"{o}}ms hos tillg{\"{a}}ngliga kandidater: det finns en risk att f{\"{o}}retaget f{\"{o}}resl{\aa}s tillg{\"{a}}ngliga, snarare {\"{a}}n bra, kandidater. De flesta rekryterings-och urvalssituationer ser dock annorlunda ut; oftast handlar det om medelkomplexa befattningar, utan h{\"{o}}gre formella krav, och inte s{\"{a}}llan {\"{a}}r det flera tj{\"{a}}nster som ska tills{\"{a}}ttas samtidigt.

Cognitive-behavior therapies (CBT), varying between 9 and 18 weeks of treatment, are considered evidence-based for the treatment of anxiety disorders in youth. During the last two decades treatments that are brief, intensive, or concentrated (BIC) have been developed and this meta-analysis includes 23 RCTs of these new approaches across the anxiety disorders. BIC yielded a lower attrition (2.3{\%}) than standard CBT (6.5{\%}). The effect sizes (ES) for comparison of BIC with waiting-list (1.47) and placebo (0.91) were significant, whereas that with standard CBT (0.01) was not. Regarding remission at post/recovery at follow-up BIC (54{\%}/64{\%}) and standard CBT (57{\%}/63{\%}) were comparable and both were significantly higher than placebo (26{\%}/35{\%}), which was higher than WLC (7{\%}/9{\%}). Within-group ES at post and follow-up were 1.50 and 1.53 for BIC, and 0.98 and 1.05 for standard CBT, indicating maintenance of the effects up to 12 months after therapy. Advantages and disadvantages of BIC are discussed and we suggest that BIC-interventions represent a paradigm shift in the delivery of services for youth with anxiety disorders.},

This discovery has raised the prospects of a motor theory of social cognition.

In addition to posterior estimates of causal effects, the framework yields updating on the analytical assumptions underlying correlational analysis and process tracing. We illustrate the BIQQ approach with two applications to substantive issues that have received significant quantitative and qualitative treatment in political science: the origins of electoral systems and the causes of civil war. Finally, we demonstrate how the framework can yield guidance on multimethod research design, presenting results on the optimal combinations of qualitative and quantitative data collection under different research conditions.},

Nausea, voices, and pain are examples of internal (interoceptive) stimuli closely linked with a disease and/or its treatment. There is evidence that the perception and, hence, role of these internal stimuli can be modified by one's learning history. There is also increased awareness by researchers and practitioners of the potential import of learning involving internal states to some diseases and psychopathologies. Unfortunately, the science, theory, and practice appear to be trailing behind awareness. In this mini-review, we describe two examples: smoking and panic disorder. While doing so, we discuss the need to develop translationally relevant animal models that will allow investigators to better understand the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying interoception and learning.},

The aim of the two presented studies was to test the proposed association of cardiac vagal tone (CVT), assessed via resting high-frequency heart rate variability (respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA), with coping, emotion-regulation, and social engagement in young adults. In Study 1 (retrospective self-report), RSA was positively associated with engagement coping (situation control, response control, positive self-instructions, social-support seeking) and aspects of social well-being. In Study 2 (ecological momentary assessment), for 28 days following the initial assessment, RSA predicted less use of disengagement strategies (acceptance and avoidance) for regulating negative emotions and more use of socially adaptive emotion-regulation strategies (i.e., social-support seeking as a reaction to sadness and making a concession as a reaction to anger caused by others). Furthermore, RSA was higher in participants who reported no anger episodes compared to those who reported at least one anger episode and was positively associated with reported episodes of negative emotions. Results support the association proposed by the PVT between CVT and self-regulatory behavior, which promotes social bonds.},

abstract = {If perception corresponds to hypothesis testing (Gregory, 1980); then visual searches might be construed as experiments that generate sensory data. In this work, we explore the idea that saccadic eye movements are optimal experiments, in which data are gathered to test hypotheses or beliefs about how those data are caused. This provides a plausible model of visual search that can be motivated from the basic principles of selforganized behavior: namely, the imperative to minimize the entropy of hidden states of the world and their sensory consequences. This imperative is met if agents sample hidden states of the world efficiently. This efficient sampling of salient information can be derived in a fairly straightforward way, using approximate Bayesian inference and variational freeenergy minimization. Simulations of the resulting active inference scheme reproduce sequential eye movements that are reminiscent of empirically observed saccades and provide some counterintuitive insights into the way that sensory evidence is accumulated or assimilated into beliefs about the world.},

The clinical series comprised 115 patients with social phobia and 51 patients with personality disorder, 28 of whom were of the avoidant type. Support was found for internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the French SIB. Compared to controls, both social phobics and patients with an avoidant personality disorder had significantly lower mean scores on all performance scales and significantly higher ones on all distress scales, with the social phobics occupying a position in between. Findings in relation to convergent and divergent validity were quite satisfactory.

His early considerations already led him to recognize the necessity of considering the organism as a system, as an organization of parts and processes. He termed the resulting research program organismic biology, which he extended to all basic questions of biology and almost all areas of biology, hence also to the theory of evolution. This article begins by outlining the rather unknown (because often written in German) research of Bertalanffy in the field of theoretical biology. The basics of the organismic approach are then described. This is followed by Bertalanffy's considerations on the theory of evolution, in which he used methods from theoretical biology and then introduced his own, organismic, view on evolution, leading to the demand for finding laws of evolution. Finally, his view on the concept of homology is presented.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this article was to assess the predictive validity of the Adherence Estimator—a 3-item instrument designed to estimate a patient's propensity to adhere to medications prescribed for chronic disease. Methods: The Adherence Estimator was a 3-item part of a larger survey mailed to adults aged ≥40 years who had a qualifying index prescription filled in June 2008. A qualifying prescription was defined as one for a medication indicated for the treatment of 1 of 5 chron-ic diseases (cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia [lipid-lowering drugs], diabetes [oral antihyperglycemics], osteoporosis [oral bisphosphonates], or asthma). Out-comes were compared between the adherence risk groups derived from the Adherence Estimator (low risk = score of 0, medium risk = score of 2–7, and high risk = score of 8–36). Treatment persistence over a period of 9 months was measured using pharmacy claims data. The primary outcome was the median proportion of days covered (PDC) by ≥1 medication during the first 9 months after the index fill. Secondary outcomes in-cluded adherence to the index medication, defined as PDC dichotomized to ≥0.80 or {\textless}0.80; rate of obtaining a second fill within 30 days of the index fill; and medi-cation possession ratio (MPR) for refill adherence. Results: There were 1676 usable responses. Ages ranged from 40 to 88 years, with a mean of 64.6 years. Almost two thirds (1076/1676 [64.2{\%}]) of the sample were female, and 1483/1676 (88.5{\%}) were white. Statistically significant associations for all 3 pairwise comparisons (low vs medium risk, low vs high risk, and medium vs high risk) were observed between the Adherence Estimator risk groups for: (1) median PDC (0.655, 0.598, and 0.484 in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups, respectively [all, false discovery rate [FDR] {\textless}0.05]); (2) PDC categorized (293/711 [41.21{\%}], 200/588 [34.01{\%}], and 105/377 [27.85{\%}] [all, FDR {\textless}0.05]); and (3) rate of obtaining a second fill for the index medication within 30 days (489/711 [68.78{\%}], 374/588 [63.61{\%}], and 207/377 [54.91{\%}] [all, FDR {\textless}0.05]). The low-and high-risk groups differed from one another on: (1) persistence with the index medication at 9 months (265/711 [37.27{\%}] and 95/377 [25.20{\%}]); (2) persistence with ≥1 medication at 9 months (291/711 [40.93{\%}] and 108/377 [28.65{\%}]); and (3) obtaining a second fill for any medication within 30 days (501/711 [70.46{\%}] and 219/377 [59.09{\%}]) (all, P {\textless} 0.05). The low-and high-risk groups differed significantly from one another in MPR for refill adherence (0.912 vs 0.866). Results observed within diseases mirrored those for the total sample, but with less precision. Conclusion: In the present analysis of the validity of the Adherence Estimator in predicting adherence, base-line propensity to adhere to medications prescribed for chronic diseases was statistically associated with sev-eral measures of adherence and persistence, as derived from pharmacy claims data, over a 9-month period.},

Interestingly, the common serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) does the same. While neural mechanisms underlying SPS are largely unknown, those associated with the 5-HTTLPR have been extensively inves-tigated. We perform a comparative analysis of research findings on sensory processing facets associated with the trait and polymorphism to: 1. detect shared phenotypes and frame a hypothesis towards neural mechanisms underlying SPS; 2. increase the understanding of 5-HTTLPR-associated behavioral patterns. Trait and polymorphism are both associated with differential susceptibility to environmental stimuli; additionally, both involve 1. having stronger emotional reactions, 2. processing of sensory information more deeply, 3. being more aware of environmental subtleties, and 4. being easily overstimulated. We discuss neural mechanisms and environmental conditions that may underlie these four facets. Besides urging the actual assessment of the link between the two, the conclusions of our analyses may guide and focus future research strategies.},

The highly conserved stress hormone response influences many brain regions, particularly the hippocampus, a region important for memory function. The effect of acute stress on the unique population of adult neural stem/ progenitor cells (NPCs) that resides in the adult hippocampus is unclear. We found that acute stress increased hippocampal cell proliferation and astrocytic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression. The effect of acute stress occurred independent of basolateral amygdala neural input and was mimicked by treating isolated NPCs with conditioned media from corticosterone-treated primary astrocytes. Neutralization of FGF2 revealed that astrocyte-secreted FGF2 mediated stress-hormone-induced NPC proliferation. 2 weeks, but not 2 days, after acute stress, rats also showed enhanced fear extinction memory coincident with enhanced activation of newborn neurons. Our findings suggest a beneficial role for brief stress on the hippocampus and improve understanding of the adaptive capacity of the brain.},

The aim of the current study was therefore to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of g-MCT for GAD within a community mental health setting whilst addressing limitations evident in the previous study. Methods: The study used an open trial design, and 23 consecutively referred adults with GAD completed 10 sessions (90 min) of g-MCT, delivered by two therapists trained in MCT. Diagnoses were assessed by trained raters using the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule-IV. All patients but one had previous psychosocial treatment, and 17 (73.9{\%}) had at least one comorbid axis-I disorder. Self-reported symptoms were assessed using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at pre-and post-treatment as well as 3-month follow-up. Feasibility was assessed using rates of patients who declined group treatment in favor of individual treatment, patients not able to attend due to pre-scheduled dates for sessions, and drop-out rate. Results: Of 32 eligible participants, six patients (19{\%}) declined g-MCT in favor of individual MCT, and three (9{\%}) were unable to attend due to scheduling conflicts. No patients dropped out during treatment, but two patients did not complete the self-report questionnaires at 3-month follow-up. g-MCT was associated with significant reductions in worry, anxiety, depression, metacognitive beliefs, and maladaptive coping. According to the standardized Jacobson criteria for recovery, 65.3{\%} were recovered at post-treatment, whereas 30.4{\%} were improved and 4.3{\%} showed no change. At 3-month follow-up, the recovery rate increased to 78.3{\%}. Moreover, recovery rates were comparable for patients with-and without comorbidity. Number of therapist hours per patient was 6.5 and the treatment has now been implemented as a standard treatment option at the clinic. Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 February 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 290 Haseth et al. g-MCT for GAD Conclusion: g-MCT for GAD is an acceptable treatment which may offer a cost-effective alternative approach to individual MCT. Recovery rates and effect sizes suggested that g-MCT could be just as efficient as individual MCT and cognitive behavioral therapy.},

abstract = {Experiments on humans and other animals have shown that uncertainty due to unreliable or incomplete information affects behavior. Recent studies have formalized uncertainty and asked which behaviors would minimize its effect. This formalization results in a wide range of Bayesian models that derive from assumptions about the world, and it often seems unclear how these models relate to one another. In this review, we use the concept of graphical models to analyze differences and commonalities across Bayesian approaches to the modeling of behavioral and neural data. We review behavioral and neural data associated with each type of Bayesian model and explain how these models can be related. We finish with an overview of different theories that propose possible ways in which the brain can represent uncertainty.},

Using a mixed-methods approach, this study evaluated a participative organizational-level occupational health intervention designed to improve working conditions and psychological well-being of knowledge workers across six organizations in Denmark. The intervention was conducted over 14 months, including the planning, implementation and evaluation phases. Quantitative surveys were conducted at two time points (Ns: Time 1 = 157, Time 2 = 154, Time 1/2 = 99), and interviews and workshops were conducted at various stages. The qualitative evaluation showed that participants implemented relational and work process initiatives in response to concerns about task uncertainty, task ambiguity, job complexity and task interdependencies. The quantitative evaluation showed significant improvements in relational job characteristics and burnout. The scale of implementation depended upon employee commitment, timely support from senior management, provision of information, change process expertise, and appreciation of the social meanings and relational implications of job change initiatives. The study illuminates the challenges of job redesign in knowledge work jobs and shows that certain strategies (e.g. enriching job discretion) may not be suitable in such jobs because they may increase already problematic levels of task uncertainty and ambiguity.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Postpartum depression is a disabling psychological disorder that, if left untreated, may have negative consequences for the mother, her partner, and the child. Although women with postpartum depression often experience symptoms of anxiety as well as depression, this has been underresearched. As metacognitive therapy assumes that the underlying mechanisms for both anxiety and depression are the same, it is a potentially useful psychological treatment for postpartum depression. METHODS: A pilot study was carried out using a multiple-baseline single case series to examine the effects associated with metacognitive therapy in the treatment of depression. Six women with postpartum depression were assigned to no-treatment baselines of 3 to 6 weeks, followed by 8 to 12 sessions of metacognitive therapy. Follow-up with participants took place at 3 and 6 months posttreatment. RESULTS: All participants experienced clinically significant reductions in symptoms of depression and anxiety, with corresponding reductions in metacognitive beliefs consistent with the idea that this may be the mechanism by which change occurred. Furthermore, all scores fell within the normal range posttreatment, and effect sizes were large. Treatment gains were maintained at 3 and 6 months posttreatment by all participants. DISCUSSION: This pilot study suggests that metacognitive therapy may be an effective psychological treatment for postpartum depression.},

So far, human psychology has been unsuccessful due to the mistaken notion that introspection is the only method available to psychology, and that it is the study of consciousness. Actually, psychology is the study of behavior and therefore need not take recourse to conscious phenomena. Hence, animal psychology is as valid a field of study as human psychology. The laws of behavior of animals must be determined and evaluated in and for themselves, regardless of their generalizability to other animals or humans. This suggested elimination of states of consciousness as the objects of investigation will remove the barrier that exists between psychology and other natural sciences, without neglecting the essential problems of introspective psychology.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine treatment compliance and dosage administration associated with infliximab, etanercept, and methotrexate therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis using administrative and claims data from a large US health plan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were Medicare or commercial enrollees in a health plan with a pharmacy benefit and had a diagnosis of RA. The first (index) claim for infliximab, etanercept, or methotrexate occurred between July 1, 1998, and December 31, 2000. Continuous enrollment in the plan was required from 182 days before to 365 days after the index claim. Treatment groups were compared according to compliance (defined as the actual number of therapy administrations or filled prescriptions divided by the expected number) and changes in dosage administration over time. The costs of infliximab therapy also were explored. RESULTS: A total of 2662 patients (infliximab = 141; etanercept = 853; and methotrexate = 1668) were included in the analyses. Infliximab patients were older and more likely to have a Medicare benefit. In addition, infliximab patients had more comorbidities and had greater medical costs preceding the index claim. Compliance with at least 80{\%} of the expected dosages was significantly lower for etanercept (odds ratio [OR] 0.462; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 0.290-0.736) and methotrexate (OR 0.385; 95{\%} CI 0.245-0.604) patients than infliximab patients. Methotrexate patients had the largest dosage increases (61.6{\%}), followed by infliximab (37.4{\%}) and etanercept (7.4{\%}) patients. Assuming 6.5 dosages per year, the annual cost of infliximab was dollars 10446 to dollars 12363, or dollars 1887 to dollars 1902 per administration, depending on site of service. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance is higher with infliximab compared with etanercept or methotrexate; whereas, fewer etanercept patients change dosages. The cost of infliximab was lower than expected based on previous predictions, even with a 37{\%} increase in dosage.},

abstract = {Objective: This paper examines the effects of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for depression (ACT-D), and the specific effects of experiential acceptance and mindfulness, in reducing suicidal ideation (SI) and depression among Veterans. Method: Patients included 981 Veterans, 76{\%} male, mean age 50.5 years. Depression severity and SI were assessed using the BDI-II. Experiential acceptance and mindfulness were measured with the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II) and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, respectively. Results: Of the 981 patients, 647 (66.0{\%}) completed 10 or more sessions or finished early due to symptom relief. For Veterans with SI at baseline, mean BDI-II score decreased from 33.5 to 22.9. For Veterans with no SI at baseline, mean BDI-II score decreased from 26.3 to 15.9. Mixed models with repeated measurement indicated a significant reduction in depression severity from baseline to final assessment (b = -10.52, p {\textless} .001). After adjusting for experiential acceptance and mindfulness, patients with SI at baseline demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depression severity during ACT-D treatment, relative to patients with no SI at baseline (b = -2.81, p = .001). Furthermore, increases in experiential acceptance and mindfulness scores across time were associated with a reduction in depression severity across time (b = -0.44, p {\textless} .001 and b = -0.09, p {\textless} .001, respectfully), and the attenuating effect of mindfulness on depression severity increased across time (b = -0.05, p = .042). Increases in experiential acceptance scores across time were associated with lower odds of SI across time (odds ratio = 0.97, 95{\%} CI [0.95, 0.99], p = .016) and the attenuating effect of experiential acceptance on SI increased across time (odds ratio = 0.96, 95{\%} CI [0.92, 0.99], p = .023). Overall the number of patients with no SI increased from 44.5{\%} at baseline to 65{\%} at follow-up. Conclusions: Veterans receiving ACT-D demonstrated decreased depression severity and decreased odds of SI during treatment. Increases in experiential acceptance and mindfulness scores were associated with reduction in depression severity across time and increases in experiential acceptance scores were associated with reductions in SI across time.},

abstract = {The brutal murder of James Byrd Jr. in June 1998 unleashed a storm of media, interest groups, high profile individuals and criticism on the Southeast Texas community of Jasper. The crime and subsequent response— from within the community as well as across the world— engulfed the entire town in a collective trauma. Using natural disaster literature/theory and employing an ecolog-ical approach, Jasper, Texas was investigated via an inter-rupted time series analysis to identify how the community changed as compared to a control community (Center, Texas) on crime, economic, health, educational, and social capital measures collected at multiple pre-and post-crime time points between 1995 and 2003. Differences-in-differ-ences (DD) analysis revealed significant post-event changes in Jasper, as well as a surprising degree of resilience and lack of negative consequences. Interviews with residents conducted between March 2005 and 2007 identified how the community responded to the crisis and augmented quantitative findings with qualitative, field-informed inter-pretation. Interviews suggest the intervention of external organizations exacerbated the severity of the events. However, using strengths of specific local social institu-tions—including faith based, law enforcement, media, business sector and civic government organizations—the community effectively responded to the initial threat and to the potential negative ramifications of external entities.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among young people globally. In light of emerging evidence supporting the effectiveness of school-based suicide prevention programmes, an analysis of cost-effectiveness is required. We aimed to conduct a full cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of the large pan-European school-based RCT, Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE). The health outcomes of interest were suicide attempt and severe suicidal ideation with suicide plans. Adopting a payer's perspective, three suicide prevention interventions were modelled with a Control over a 12-month time period. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) indicate that the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) programme has the lowest incremental cost per 1{\%} point reduction in incident for both outcomes and per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained versus the Control. The ICERs reported for YAM were €34.83 and €45.42 per 1{\%} point reduction in incident suicide attempt and incident severe suicidal ideation, respectively, and a cost per QALY gained of €47,017 for suicide attempt and €48,216 for severe suicidal ideation. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were used to examine uncertainty in the QALY analysis, where cost-effectiveness probabilities were calculated using net monetary benefit analysis incorporating a two-stage bootstrapping technique. For suicide attempt, the probability that YAM was cost-effective at a willingness to pay of €47,000 was 39{\%}. For severe suicidal ideation, the probability that YAM was cost-effective at a willingness to pay of €48,000 was 43{\%}. This CEA supports YAM as the most cost-effective of the SEYLE interventions in preventing both a suicide attempt and severe suicidal ideation. Trial registration number DRKS00000214.},

abstract = {Abstract Recent technological developments, such as single unit recordings coupled to optogenetic approaches, have provided unprecedented knowledge about the precise neuronal circuits contributing to the expression and recovery of conditioned fear behavior. These data have provided an understanding of the contributions of distinct brain regions such as the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and periaqueductal gray matter to the control of conditioned fear behavior. Notably, the precise manipulation and identification of specific cell types by optogenetic techniques have provided novel avenues to establish causal links between changes in neuronal activity that develop in dedicated neuronal structures and the short and long-lasting expression of conditioned fear memories. In this review, we provide an update on the key neuronal circuits and cell types mediating conditioned fear expression and recovery and how these new discoveries might refine therapeutic approaches for psychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder.},

The authors present simulations that establish key differences in the operating characteristics of the hippocampal-recall and MTLC-familiarity signals and identify several manipulations (e.g., target-lure similarity, interference) that differentially affect the 2 signals.

abstract = {This paper explores the development of BPD as it might emerge in the child's early interpersonal reactions and how such reactions might evolve into the interpersonal pattern that typifies BPD. It begins to bridge the relevant bodies of clinical literature on the borderline's prototypic interpersonal problems with the concurrently expanding relevant literature on early child development. We will start by considering how a psychobiological disposition to BPD is likely to include a constitutional diathesis for relational reactivity, that is, for hypersensitivity to interpersonal stressors. Data relevant to this disposition's manifestations in adult clinical samples and to its heritability and neurobiology will be reviewed. We then consider how such a psychobiological disposition for interpersonal reactivity might contribute to the development of a disorganized-ambivalent form of attachment, noting especially the likely contributions of both the predisposed child and of parents who are themselves predisposed to maladaptive responses, leading to an escalation of problematic transactions. Evidence concerning both the genetics and the developmental pathways associated with disorganized attachments will be considered. Emerging links between such developmental pathways and adult BPD will be described, in particular the potential appearance by early- to middle-childhood of controlling-caregiving or controlling-punitive interpersonal strategies. Some implications from this gene-environment interactional theory for a better developmental understanding of BPD's etiology are discussed.},

It has been criticized not only by behavior analysts but also by social and evolutionary psychologists, neuroscientists, and authors who are or used to be cognitivists themselves. At the same time, psychologists and neuroscientists in several fields are now rediscovering the necessity of un- derstanding behavior in light of its functional relations. Hence a need for rel- evant knowledge is felt. Cognitive psychology has little to offer in this regard. Behavior analysis, on the other hand, possesses a wealth of relevant facts and theory. Though chances seem slight that mainstream psychology will return to behaviorism, a window of opportunity now exists for the reintegration of behavior-analytic research into the mainstream.},

Interest in glutamatergic dysfunction in autism is high due to increasing convergent evidence implicating the system in the disorder from peripheral biomarkers, neuroimaging, protein expression, genetics and animal models. Currently, there are no pharmaceutical interventions approved for autism that address glutamate deficits in the disorder. New treatments related to glutamatergic neurotransmission, however, are emerging. In addition, older glutamate-modulating medications with approved indications for use in other disorders are being investigated for re-tasking as treatments for autism.

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that acute psychosocial stress impairs recognition of declarative memory and that emotional material is especially sensitive to this effect. Animal studies suggest a central role of the amygdala which modulates memory processes in hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and other brain areas. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural correlates of stress-induced modulation of emotional recognition memory in humans. Twenty-seven healthy, right-handed, non-smoker male volunteers performed an emotional face recognition task. During encoding, participants were presented with 50 fearful and 50 neutral faces. One hour later, they underwent either a stress (Trier Social Stress Test) or a control procedure outside the scanner which was followed immediately by the recognition session inside the scanner, where participants had to discriminate between 100 old and 50 new faces. Stress increased salivary cortisol, blood pressure and pulse, and decreased the mood of participants but did not impact recognition memory. BOLD data during recognition revealed a stress condition by emotion interaction in the left inferior frontal gyrus and right hippocampus which was due to a stress-induced increase of neural activity to fearful and a decrease to neutral faces. Functional connectivity analyses revealed a stress-induced increase in coupling between the right amygdala and the right fusiform gyrus, when processing fearful as compared to neutral faces. Our results provide evidence that acute psychosocial stress affects medial temporal and frontal brain areas differentially for neutral and emotional items, with a stress-induced privileged processing of emotional stimuli.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are common among patients attending cardiac rehabilitation services. Currently available pharmacological and psychological interventions have limited effectiveness in this population. There are presently no psychological interventions for anxiety and depression integrated into cardiac rehabilitation services despite emphasis in key UK National Health Service policy. A new treatment, metacognitive therapy, is highly effective at reducing anxiety and depression in mental health settings. The principal aims of the current study are (1) to evaluate the acceptability of delivering metacognitive therapy in a home-based self-help format (Home-MCT) to cardiac rehabilitation patients experiencing anxiety and depressive symptoms and conduct a feasibility trial of Home-MCT plus usual cardiac rehabilitation compared to usual cardiac rehabilitation; and (2) to inform the design and sample size for a full-scale trial. METHODS: The PATHWAY Home-MCT trial is a single-blind feasibility randomised controlled trial comparing usual cardiac rehabilitation (control) versus usual cardiac rehabilitation plus home-based self-help metacognitive therapy (intervention). Economic and qualitative evaluations will be embedded within the trial. Participants will be assessed at baseline and followed-up at 4 and 12 months. Patients who have been referred to cardiac rehabilitation programmes and have a score of {\textgreater}/= 8 on the anxiety and/or depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale will be invited to take part in the study and written informed consent will be obtained. Participants will be recruited from the National Health Service in the UK. A minimum of 108 participants will be randomised to the intervention and control arms in a 1:1 ratio. DISCUSSION: The Home-MCT feasibility randomised controlled trial will provide evidence on the acceptability of delivering metacognitive therapy in a home-based self-help format for cardiac rehabilitation patients experiencing symptoms of anxiety and/or depression and on the feasibility and design of a full-scale trial. In addition, it will provide provisional point estimates, with appropriately wide measures of uncertainty, relating to the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

Within this context, the APA 2005 Presidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice defines and discusses evidence-based practice in psychology (EBPP). In an integration of science and practice, the Task Force's report describes psychology's fundamental commitment to sophisticated EBPP and takes into account the full range of evidence psychologists and policymakers must consider. Research, clinical expertise, and patient characteristics are all supported as relevant to good outcomes. EBPP promotes effective psychological practice and enhances public health by applying empirically supported principles of psychological assessment, case formulation, therapeutic relationship, and intervention. The report provides a rationale for and expanded discussion of the EBPP policy statement that was developed by the Task Force and adopted as association policy by the APA Council of Representatives in August 2005.},

The spontaneous play groups occurring during the free-play hour were observed by a one-minute sampling and the social behavior of each child was recorded. Social participation was classified under: unoccupied; solitary play; onlooker; parallel group activity; associative group play; and cooperative group play. Unoccupied behavior was observed in only five children, while all children engaged in solitary play. All but two children were observed in onlooker situations, and all but one in associative play groups. Parallel activity occurred more often than any other; two-thirds of the children played in this manner over 33{\%} of the time. Cooperative play occupied from 1 to 57{\%} of the observations. Correlation of social participation was made with several other factors: (1) social participation is dependent to a large extent upon the age of children, (2) there is a slight relationship between intelligence quotients and the degree of social participation of individuals (.26), (3) nursery-school experience correlated with social participation scores .12.},

abstract = {A multiple baseline design across participants was used to determine how teacher greetings affected ontask behavior of 3 middle school students with problem behaviors. Momentary time sampling was used to measure ontask behavior during the first 10 min of class. Teacher greetings produced increases in students' ontask behavior from a mean of 45{\%} in baseline to a mean of 72{\%} during the intervention phase. Teacher greetings represent an antecedent manipulation that can easily be implemented in classrooms to improve students' ontask behavior. In secondary education classrooms, the first several minutes of a class period are crucial for completing a variety of administrative tasks such as taking attendance, collecting assignments, and making announcements. To facilitate completion of these tasks, Emmer, Evertson, and Worsham (2006) suggested that teachers assign an activity for students to perform independently during the first 10 min of class. However, it can be challenging for teachers to achieve and maintain student ontask behavior while simultaneously completing administrative tasks. Given these competing demands, teachers may be likely to inadvertently reinforce students' offtask behavior by attending to students only when they are off task. When this occurs, classroom contingencies are likely to promote offtask rather than ontask behavior. A growing body of research identifies the benefits of manipulating antecedent variables to reduce problem behavior and increase},

First, the authors focus on the principles of multistability, feedback, and nonlinear causality to reconceptualize real-time parent–child and peer processes. Second, they model the mecha- nisms by which these real-time processes give rise to negative developmental outcomes, which in turn feed back to determine real-time interactions. Third, they examine mechanisms of change and stability in early- and late-onset antisocial trajectories. Finally, novel clinical designs and predictions are introduced.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To provide clinical practitioners with a framework for teaching patients Time Pressure Management, a cognitive strategy that aims to reduce disabilities arising from mental slowness due to acquired brain injury. Time Pressure Management provides patients with compensatory strategies to deal with time pressure in daily life. Application of the training in clinical practice is illustrated using two case examples from a randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of Time Pressure Management for patients with stroke. RATIONALE: The Time Pressure Management approach is based on Michon's task analysis, describing levels of decision-making in complex cognitive tasks. Decisions with little or no time pressure are not impaired by mental slowness. Therefore, patients should try to transfer actions from situations with high time pressure to situations where the preserved decision levels with little or no time pressure can work. THEORY INTO PRACTICE: Several factors are required to teach patients to use Time Pressure Management. First, sufficient awareness is needed to recognize that there is a deficit and behavioural change is necessary. Sufficient awareness is also required to recognize and anticipate time pressure situations and to realize that the strategy is helpful and might also be useful in new and more difficult circumstances. Second, adequate motivation is needed to learn the strategy. And finally, the training should be adjusted to the patient's individual learning abilities and cognitive skills.},

Modality-specific 'embodied' mechanisms anchored in sensorimotor systems appear to be relevant, as are 'disembodied' mechanisms in multimodal areas. In this paper, four semantic mechanisms are proposed and spelt out at the level of neuronal circuits: referential semantics, which establishes links between symbols and the objects and actions they are used to speak about; combinatorial semantics, which enables the learning of symbolic meaning from context; emotional-affective semantics, which establishes links between signs and internal states of the body; and abstraction mechanisms for generalizing over a range of instances of semantic meaning. Referential, combinatorial, emotional-affective, and abstract semantics are complementary mechanisms, each necessary for processing meaning in mind and brain. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, we use the quantitative and qualitative process data from an organizational intervention conducted in a national postal service, where the Intervention Process Measure questionnaire (N = 285) as well as an extensive interview study (N = 50) were used. We analyze what type of knowledge about intervention processes these two methodologies provide and discuss strengths and weaknesses as well as potentials for mixed methods evaluation methodologies.},

abstract = {[From The Philosophical Review LXXXIII, 4 (October 1974): 435-50.] Consciousness is what makes the mind-body problem really intractable. Perhaps that is why current discussions of the problem give it little attention or get it obviously wrong. The recent wave of reductionist euphoria has produced several analyses of mental phenomena and mental concepts designed to explain the possibility of some variety of materialism, psychophysical identification, or reduction. 1 But the problems dealt with are those common to this type of reduction and other types, and what makes the mind-body problem unique, and unlike the water-H 2 O problem or the Turing machine-IBM machine problem or the lightning-electrical discharge problem or the gene-DNA problem or the oak tree-hydrocarbon problem, is ignored. Every reductionist has his favorite analogy from modern science. It is most unlikely that any of these unrelated examples of successful reduction will shed light on the relation of mind to brain. But philosophers share the general human weakness for explanations of what is incomprehensible in terms suited for what is familiar and well understood, though entirely different. This has led to the acceptance of implausible accounts of the mental largely because they would permit familiar kinds of reduction. I shall try to explain why the usual examples do not help us to understand the relation between mind and body—why, indeed, we have at present no conception of what an explanation of the physical nature of a mental phenomenon would be. Without consciousness the mind-body problem would be much less interesting. With consciousness it seems hopeless. The most important and characteristic feature of conscious mental phenomena is very poorly understood. Most reductionist theories do not even try to explain it. And careful examination will show that no currently available concept of reduction is applicable to it. Perhaps a new theoretical form can be devised for the purpose, but such a solution, if it exists, lies in the distant intellectual future. Conscious experience is a widespread phenomenon. It occurs at many levels of animal life, though we cannot be sure of its presence in the simpler organisms, and it is very difficult to say in general what provides evidence of it. (Some extremists have been prepared to deny it even of mammals other than man.) No doubt it occurs in countless forms totally unimaginable to us, on other planets in other solar systems throughout the universe. But no matter how the form may vary, the fact that an organism has conscious experience at all means, basically, that there is something it is like to be that organism. There may be further implications about the form of the experience; there may even (though I doubt it) be implications about the behavior of the organism. But fundamentally an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is to be that organism—something it is like for the organism.},

abstract = {The person has persistent or recurrent experiences (episodes) of feeling detached from one's surroundings, mental processes, or body (e.g., feeling like one is in a dream, or as if one is looking at themselves as an outside observer). In the case of depersonalization, the individual may feel detached from his or her entire being (e.g., “I am no one,” “I have no self”). He or she may also feel subjectively detached from aspects of the self, including feelings (e.g., hypoemotionality: “I know I have feelings but I don't feel them”), thoughts (e.g., “My thoughts don't feel like my own,” “head filled with cotton”), whole body or body parts, or sensations (e.g., touch, proprioception, hunger, thirst, libido). There may also be a diminished sense of agency (e.g., feeling robotic, like an automaton; lacking control of one's speech or movements). Episodes of derealization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals, inanimate objects, or all surroundings. The individual may feel as if he or she were in a fog, dream, or bubble, or as if there were a veil or a glass wall between the individual and world around. Surroundings may be experienced as artificial, colorless, or lifeless. Derealization is commonly accompanied by subjective visual distortions, such as blurriness, heightened acuity, widened or narrowed visual field, two-dimensionality or flatness, exaggerated three-dimensionality, or altered distance or size of objects, termed macropsia or micropsia. During the depersonalization or derealization experience, the person remains somewhat in touch with their present reality. The depersonalization causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The depersonalization experience does not occur exclusively during the course of another mental disorder, such as Schizophrenia, Panic Disorder, Acute Stress Disorder, or another Dissociative Disorder, and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy).},

abstract = {Raising a child is a difficult task, one made harder when a parent's basic expectations about that child's behavior are suddenly violated. Parents generally assume, for example, that children will engage in certain fundamental behaviors, such as eating dinner, sleeping at night, playing with friends, and going to school. When a child unexpectedly ends one of these behaviors, parents usually find themselves amid a highly unpleasant and disruptive life experience. Of these disruptions, a child's refusal to go to school may be among the most exasperating. Imagine the drain on a family when a child constantly refuses to get out of bed in the morning, locks himself or herself in the bathroom to avoid school, runs away from school at midmorning, or skips classes after lunch. The child may be severely anxious; parents may miss work; frequent or pressuring calls from the school may ensure; legal and academic problems may loom; social embarrassment may develop; siblings may become upset or miss school themselves; and family members as a whole may be confused, conflicted, and anguished over how to respond to the school refusal situation. Appreciating this anguish is a key element in fully understanding this population.},

abstract = {Versions of the “predictive brain” hypothesis rank among the most promising and the most conceptually challenging visions ever to emerge from computational and cognitive neuroscience. In this paper, I briefly introduce (section  1 ) the most radical and comprehensive of these visions —the account of “active inference”, or “action-oriented predictive processing” ( Clark   2013a ), developed by  Karl Friston  and colleagues. In section  2 , I isolate and discuss four of the framework's most provocative claims: (i) that the core flow of information is top-down, not bottom-up, with the forward flow of sensory information replaced by the forward flow of prediction error; (ii) that motor control is just more top-down sensory prediction; (iii) that efference copies, and distinct “controllers”, can be replaced by top-down predictions; and (iv) that cost functions can fruitfully be replaced by predictions. Working together, these four claims offer a tantalizing glimpse of a new, integrated framework for understanding perception, action, embodiment, and the nature of human experience. I end (section  3 ) by sketching what may be the most important aspect of the emerging view: its ability to embed the use of fast and frugal solutions (as highlighted by much work in robotics and embodied cognition) within an over-arching scheme that includes more structured, knowledge-intensive strategies, combining these fluently and continuously as task and context dictate.},

abstract = {This chapter focuses on reactive attachment disorder (RAD), a condition of unremitting terror that disrupts the development of the self and renders “the other” unrecognizable. Empathy and trust cannot emerge. It is a disorder that has been refractory to treatment as it has been all but impossible to address the psychic programing of fear and distrust with standard psychotherapy. This chapter argues that neurofeedback can and does rewrite this program, first in the brain and, over time, in the mind. RAD can be seen as a discrete diagnosis. However, as attachment dynamics and their effects on brain development are better understood, it is becoming increasingly clear that early unrepaired attachment disruption is implicated in a wide range of severe disorders. It is a central premise of this chapter that where attachment issues prevail, the core affect is fear. Neurofeedback quiets fear. In doing so, it enriches the capacity for attachment and the ability to engage in meaningful relationships, including psychotherapy. It may be possible to generalize the efficacy of neurofeedback, then, in enhancing the treatment of any disorder that has attachment disruption at its root and fear as its aftermath. Attachment theory and the imperative of attachment in human beings offer practitioners a central ethical principle to guide their practice. Neurofeedback providers must understand the primacy and process of attachment, assess for attachment breaks, and pursue the repair of attachment. Through neuronal regulation, neurofeedback has the potential to promote the human birthright of attachment, love, empathy and trust.},

abstract = {For psychoanalysts, a key developmental question is how children's mentalisation capacities de-velop, that is, how they come to understand the feelings and intentions of others, as well as them-selves, and how that understanding is integrated over the course of development into their feelings for and expectations of others. Broadly stated, this question has been the subject of productive lines of inquiry among cognitive and development psychologists. During the past 15 years, inves-tigators from these disciplines focusing on the development of theory of mind have provided us with startling evidence of the abilities of very young children to understand their own behavior, as well as that of others, based on beliefs and desires. Furthermore, they have also presented fascinat-ing observations and experiments suggesting that from early infancy we attribute intentionality to people. The term theory of mind has come to designate a specific domain of inquiry and research for philosophers, cognitive developmentalists, and primatologists, with the broad goal of under-standing the ability, which may or not be exclusively human, to predict and explain the actions of self and others based on their knowledge, beliefs, and desires. Our aim in this review is to provide a summary of this body of work. PHILOSOPHY OF MIND AND THEORY OF MIND Philosophy of mind has, to a large extent, informed the terms of reference, the terminology, the priority issues, and the major debates of theory of mind research. Following the collapse of behav-iorism in the 1960s, the philosopher Lewis (1966) introduced the notion that our access to the minds of other people (and also to our own mental states) is mediated by an implicitly held theory of the functioning of the human mind. Interest in the developmental acquisition of theory of mind abilities developed much later in the 1980s with the reemergence of the Rationalist and Empiricist debate and competing theories of folk-psychological abilities as innate or learned. The philoso-pher Fodor (1987) has been one of the most influential proponents of the point of view that theory of mind abilities are innate and develop through a process of maturation, rather than through learn-ing. Subsequently, the introduction of Simulationist accounts of the development of our mind-reading abilities by philosophers such as R. M. Gordon (1992) suggested that we make sense of the actions of others by trying to imagine, or simulate, how the world looks from their},

abstract = {Classical theories of skill acquisition propose that automatization (i.e., performance requires progres-sively less attention as experience is acquired) is a defining characteristic of expertise in a variety of domains (e.g., Fitts {\&} Posner, 1967). Automaticity is believed to enhance smooth and efficient skill execution by allowing performers to focus on strategic elements of performance rather than on the mechanical details that govern task implementation (Williams {\&} Ford, 2008). By contrast, conscious processing (i.e., paying conscious attention to one's action during motor execution) has been found to disrupt skilled movement and performance proficiency (e.g., Beilock {\&} Carr, 2001). On the basis of this evidence, researchers have tended to extol the virtues of automaticity. However, few researchers have considered the wide range of empirical evidence which indicates that highly automated behaviors can, on occasion, lead to a series of errors that may prove deleterious to skilled performance. Therefore, the purpose of the current paper is to highlight the perils, rather than the virtues, of automaticity. We draw on Reason's (1990) classification scheme of everyday errors to show how an overreliance on automated procedures may lead to 3 specific performance errors (i.e., mistakes, slips, and lapses) in a variety of skill domains (e.g., sport, dance, music). We conclude by arguing that skilled performance requires the dynamic interplay of automatic processing and conscious processing in order to avoid performance errors and to meet the contextually contingent demands that characterize competitive environments in a range of skill domains.},

abstract = {My research on the stories of palliative care patients emphasizes the heterogeneity of the types of stories they tell, including stories of illness, of everyday life, of the future, and of the past (Synnes, 2012). This article pays special attention to the prevalence of stories of past experiences in which the past is portrayed through idyllic and nostalgic interpretation. In contrast to most research on illness narratives and narrative gerontology that is preoccupied with stories of change, these stories of nostalgia are characterized by a plot where nothing in particular happens. However, this may be the primary purpose for the storytellers in their particular situation of illness and imminent death. The main purpose of nostalgia is precisely to ensure the continuity of identity in the face of adversity (Davis, 1979). In this article, I argue that these stories of nostalgia are vital aspects of maintaining the continuity of the self, or a narrative identity, when much else in life is characterized by discontinuity and uncertainty. Thus, stories of nostalgia should not be dismissed as escapism but valued and listened to as important aspects of narrative care among palliative care patients, and as a way of preserving the sense of a narrative identity.},

abstract = {Background: The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) is a practical self-report anxiety questionnaire that proved valid in primary care. However, the GAD-7 was not yet validated in the general population and thus far, normative data are not available. Objectives: To investigate reliability, construct validity, and facto-rial validity of the GAD-7 in the general population and to generate normative data. Research Design: Nationally representative face-to-face household survey conducted in Germany between May 5 and June 8, 2006. Subjects: Five thousand thirty subjects (53.6{\%} female) with a mean age (SD) of 48.4 (18.0) years. Measures: The survey questionnaire included the GAD-7, the 2-item depression module from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and demographic char-acteristics. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses substantiated the 1-dimen-sional structure of the GAD-7 and its factorial invariance for gender and age. Internal consistency was identical across all subgroups (␣ ϭ 0.89). Intercorrelations with the PHQ-2 and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale were r ϭ 0.64 (P Ͻ 0.001) and r ϭ Ϫ0.43 (P Ͻ 0.001), respectively. As expected, women had significantly higher mean (SD) GAD-7 anxiety scores compared with men ͓3.2 (3.5) vs. 2.7 (3.2); P Ͻ 0.001͔. Normative data for the GAD-7 were generated for both genders and different age levels. Approximately 5{\%} of subjects had GAD-7 scores of 10 or greater, and 1{\%} had GAD-7 scores of 15 or greater. Conclusions: Evidence supports reliability and validity of the GAD-7 as a measure of anxiety in the general population. The normative data provided in this study can be used to compare a subject's GAD-7 score with those determined from a general pop-ulation reference group.},

The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a psychological treatment program consisting of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) together with some behavioral seizure control technology shown to be successful in earlier research. Methods: The method consisted of a randomized controlled trial group design with repeated measures (n = 27). All participants had an EEG verified epilepsy diagnosis with drug refractory seizures. Participants were randomized into one of two conditions, ACT or supportive therapy (ST). Therapeutic effects were measured by examining changes in quality of life (SWLS and WHOQOL) and seizure index (frequency x duration). Both treatment conditions consisted of only nine hours of professional therapy distributed in two individual and two group sessions during a four-week period. Results: The results showed significant effects over all of the dependent variables for the ACT group as compared to the ST group at six- and twelve-month follow-ups. Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that a short-term psychotherapy program combined with anticonvulsant drugs may help to prevent the long-term disability that occurs from drug refractory seizures. {\textcopyright} 2006 International League Against Epilepsy.},

abstract = {Numerous theories discuss the neuropsychological functions of the frontal lobes, most based on some concept of supramodality, and an extensive literature presents the phenomenology and semiology of language and communication deficits after focal brain lesions involving the frontal lobes. Despite this, few attempts have been made to link the clinical phenomenology to a theory. This paper presents (1) a general theory of frontal functions; (2) a brief summary of experimental and anatomical literatures in support of defined frontal functional systems; (3) clinical observations that delineate these functional systems for the specific modalities of language and communication; (4) a review of the available literature supporting the idea of specific modal and supramodal language and communication capacities; (5) hypotheses about the distributed anatomy of these functional systems; and (6) implications for traditional clinical notions of aphasia, particularly in relation to a general theory of frontal lobe functions. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {Meta-analyses reveal that homework compliance is associated with a better treatment outcome. However, little is known about the processes that could be responsible for patient compliance with homework. It has been proposed that therapist competence, in particular with respect to reviewing homework, is highly relevant for homework compliance. The present study is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Altogether, 54 patients with recurrent depressive disorder (currently in remission) who were treated with maintenance cognitive therapy (MCT), were considered. One videotaped treatment session of each patient was randomly selected and therapist competence (general competence and specific competence in setting and reviewing homework) was assessed by 2 independent raters. Furthermore, both patient and therapist views of the therapeutic alliance were evaluated by questionnaire in this therapy session. Homework compliance (considering quantitative as well as qualitative aspects) in the following session was evaluated by 2 additional raters. These 2 raters were blinded regarding the ratings of the therapeutic competence. In a multilevel path analysis model, a significant association between the therapeutic competence in reviewing homework and homework compliance was detected, while the therapeutic alliance and several patient characteristics were not associated with homework compliance. We found no relationship between homework compliance and treatment outcome. Our results demonstrate that a specific therapeutic competence (i.e., competence in reviewing homework) is associated with patient compliance with homework, and therefore, provides further empirical evidence of the importance of therapist competence in the psychotherapeutic process. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms, but PTSD's effects on the autonomic stress response and the potential influence of HRV biofeedback in stress relaxation training on improving PTSD symptoms are not well understood. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of a predeployment stress inoculation training (PRESTINT) protocol on physiologic measures of HRV in a large sample of the military population randomly assigned to experimental HRV biofeedback-assisted relaxation training versus a control condition. PRESTINT altered the parasympathetic regulation of cardiac activity, with experimental subjects exhibiting greater HRV, that is, less arousal, during a posttraining combat simulation designed to heighten arousal. Autonomic reactivity was also found to be related to PTSD and self-reported use of mental health services. Future PRESTINT training could be appropriate for efficiently teaching self-help skills to reduce the psychological harm following trauma exposure by increasing the capacity for parasympathetically modulated reactions to stress and providing a coping tool (i.e., relaxation method) for use following a stressful situation.},

PRESIT comprises education on combat and operational stress control, attentional retraining and relaxation training, and practice and assessment via a multimedia stressor environment (MSE). Heart rate variability (HRV) and a reaction time task assessed learned skills and inoculation to MSE arousal. Participants with deployment experience and who were in the experimental group demonstrated improvement, measured as greater relaxation demonstrated during the MSE of a follow-up session relative to that of a baseline session. There was also a training effect for this group, such that those participants who showed greater relaxation from a baseline HRV state during the training (i.e., on relaxation breathing and focusing) showed more improvement between sessions. In contrast, there were no significant predictive variables for the participants in training who had never deployed. Participants with more Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms at baseline showed more capability for improvement, as was true for participants who were more anxious about their next deployment.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the technical background, and initial clinical results obtained in an implementation of live Z-score-based training (LZT) in an EEG biofeedback system. This approach makes it possible to compute, view, and process normative Z-scores in real-time as a fundamental element of EEG biofeedback. While employing the same type of database as conventional QEEG post-processing software, LZTsoftware is configured to produce results in real-time, suiting it to live assessment and training, rather than solely for analysis and review. The Z-scores described here are based upon a published database, and computed using the same software code that exists in the analysis software, when used in “dynamic JTFA” mode. The database includes over 600 people, age 2 to 82. The system computes real-time Z-scores using JTFA (joint time frequency analysis) rather than using the FFT (fast fourier transform), which is more commonly used for obtaining post-processed results. As a result, Z-scores are available instantaneously, without windowing delays, and can be used to provide real-time information. Live Z-scores can be used either for live assessment or for feedback training, depending on how the system is configured and used. When used for assessment, live Z-scores can be viewed during data acquisition, and can also be recorded and reviewed, as a simple, fast assessment. When used for training, the Z-scores must be integrated in some fashion into the feedback design, so that they are used to control displays, sounds, or other information, for purposes of operant conditioning and related learning paradigms.},

An audio CD with acceptance and mindfulness exercises and a separate workbook were also included in the treatment. Participants diagnosed with GAD (N ¼ 103) were randomly allocated to immediate therapist-guided internet-delivered acceptance-based behaviour therapy or to a waiting-list control condition. A six month follow-up was also included. Results using hierarchical linear modelling showed moderate to large effects on symptoms of GAD (Cohen's d ¼ 0.70 to 0.98), moderate effects on depressive symptoms (Cohen's d ¼ 0.51 to 0.56), and no effect on quality of life. Follow-up data showed maintained effects. While there was a 20{\%} dropout rate, sensitivity analyses showed that dropouts did not differ in their degree of change during treatment. To conclude, our study suggests that internet-delivered acceptance-based behaviour therapy can be effective in reducing the symptoms of GAD.},

abstract = {Although several self-report inventories of assertive behaviors are available for clinical and research use, normative data currently available on these measures provide only a gross index with regard to an individual's assertiveness relative to others in his social milieu. A study was conducted to develop more specific normative data for the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule (RAS). The RAS was administered to 133 undergraduates, and percentile norms were developed from the obtained distribution of total scores. In addition, derived scores were calculated from Z score norms developed for each item. The percentile norms provide information on an individual's overall assertiveness relative to others in his social milieu, while the item norms provide information as to relative assertiveness in specific target situations. It is suggested that the percentile norms might prove most useful in research with groups for which only a gross index of relative assertiveness is required. Normative data for the items of the RAS should be clinically useful, not only to pinpoint areas of deficit assertive behavior, but also to assess behavior change after therapeutic intervention. The need for additional research is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Consciousness has many aspects. These include awareness of the world, feelings of control over one's behaviour and mental state (volition), and the notion of a continuing self. Focal (executive) attention is used to control details of our awareness and is thus closely related to volition. Experiments suggest an integrated network of neural areas involved in executive attention. This network is associated with our voluntary ability to select among competing items, to correct error and to regulate our emotions. Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that these various functions involve separate areas of the anterior cingulate. We have adopted a strategy of using marker tasks, shown to activate the brain area by imaging studies, as a means of tracing the development of attentional networks. Executive attention appears to develop ¢rst to regulate distress during the ¢rst year of life. During later childhood the ability to regulate con{\pounds}ict among competing stimuli builds upon the earlier cingulate anatomy to provide a means of cognitive control. During childhood the activation of cingulate structures relates both to the child's success on laboratory tasks involving con{\pounds}ict and to parental reports of self-regulation and emotional control. These studies indicate a start in understanding the anatomy, circuitry and development of executive attention networks that serve to regulate both cognition and emotion.},

abstract = {Acceptance, the willingness to experience thoughts, feelings, and physiological sensations without having to control them or let them determine one's actions, is a major individual determinant of mental health and behavioral effectiveness in a more recent theory of psychopathology. This 2-wave panel study examined the ability of acceptance also to explain mental health, job satisfaction, and performance in the work domain. The authors hypothesized that acceptance would predict these 3 outcomes 1 year later in a sample of customer service center workers in the United Kingdom (N ϭ 412). Results indicated that acceptance predicted mental health and an objective measure of performance over and above job control, negative affectivity, and locus of control. These beneficial effects of having more job control were enhanced when people had higher levels of acceptance. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical relevance of this individual characteristic to occupational health and performance. Most work psychologists maintain that both the design of work (e.g., having job control) and individual characteristics (e.g., neg-ative affectivity) contribute to people's mental health and work They are not alone. Psychopathologists also posit and test theories of how mental health and effective behavior is promoted, protected, and improved. Psychological acceptance (also referred to as acceptance) is a major individual determinant of mental health and behavioral effectiveness, as hypothesized by one of the more recent, empirically based theories of psychopathology (e.g., Hayes, 1987; Hayes, Strosahl, {\&} Wilson, 1999). It refers to a willingness to experience thoughts, feelings, and physiological sensations, especially those which are negatively evaluated (e.g., fear), without having to avoid them or let them determine one's actions. We hypothesize that acceptance, developed to explain mental health and performance in a way that is most relevant to clinical psychology, can also help individuals to understand these outcomes in a context that can inform organizational behavior. To investigate this possibility, the present two-wave panel study used structural equation models to test the extent to which accep-tance predicts mental health, job satisfaction, and work perfor-mance, one year later. Because the way that work is designed, or organized, also affects these outcomes (e.g., Quick et al., 1997), we wished to examine the predictive effects of acceptance while accounting for those of job control—research consistently shows that this work organization variable is associated with occupational health and productivity (e.g., Terry {\&} Jimmieson, 1999). We are not, however, merely interested in accounting for job control; rather, we hypothesize that acceptance interacts with this work design variable to predict the three outcomes that we were exam-ining. We tested this theoretically based prediction (Bond {\&} Hayes, 2002) in the present study. Another goal of this research was to determine whether mental health, job satisfaction, and work performance also predict levels of acceptance and job control 1 year later. Such " reciprocal " relationships run contrary to relevant theories (e.g., Hayes, 1987; Karasek {\&} Theorell, 1990); however, by testing for them, we can examine these unidirectional hypotheses. From all of these analy-ses, we assessed the extent to which a more recent psychopathology-based theory of mental health and behavioral effectiveness may explain occupational health and performance.},

Eysenck was probably correct about the beneficial effects of behavior therapies, but did not foresee that behavior therapy would be supplanted by cognitive behavior therapies (CBT) and eclectic mixtures of CBT that incorporate elements of eastern religion, humanistic interventions, and psychodynamic constructs. Fortunately, most of the treatments that have been tested in rigorous investigations have been found to be effective, but few have distinguished themselves as uniquely superior. Many of the problems of how to measure the effects of treatment have been solved and suggest that about two thirds of treated individuals improve or recover. This leaves a sizable portion of nonresponding individuals, but emerging methods involving in tracking treatment response are being used to decrease deterioration and enhance positive outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {For more than 50 y ecologists have believed that spatial hetero-geneity in habitat conditions promotes species richness by in-creasing opportunities for niche partitioning. However, a recent stochastic model combining the main elements of niche theory and island biogeography theory suggests that environmental hetero-geneity has a general unimodal rather than a positive effect on species richness. This result was explained by an inherent tradeoff between environmental heterogeneity and the amount of suitable area available for individual species: for a given area, as hetero-geneity increases, the amount of effective area available for individual species decreases, thereby reducing population sizes and increasing the likelihood of stochastic extinctions. Here we provide a comprehensive evaluation of this hypothesis. First we analyze an extensive database of breeding bird distribution in Catalonia and show that patterns of species richness, species abun-dance, and extinction rates are consistent with the predictions of the area–heterogeneity tradeoff and its proposed mechanisms. We then perform a metaanalysis of heterogeneity–diversity relation-ships in 54 published datasets and show that empirical data better fit the unimodal pattern predicted by the area–heterogeneity tradeoff than the positive pattern predicted by classic niche theory. Simulations in which species may have variable niche widths along a continuous environmental gradient are consistent with all empir-ical findings. The area–heterogeneity tradeoff brings a unique per-spective to current theories of species diversity and has important implications for biodiversity conservation. habitat heterogeneity | neutral theory | stochastic model of community dynamics | conservation planning},

abstract = {The concept of employee empowerment is addressed frequently in the organizational communication, organizational behavior, organization theory, organizational development, and management literature, and is of significant interest to organizational and management researchers and practitioners. Despite all the attention given employee empowerment by both the academic and popular media, and by organizations themselves, there is little agreement among either scholars or practitioners as to the exact nature of the empowerment construct. There is no generally accepted definition of empowerment, and consequently no commonly approved method used to measure it. Attempts to identify the specific individual components or dimensions of empowerment and to develop measurement around these specific dimensions have only begun recently. The Perception of Empowerment Instrument presented here measures the empowerment dimensions of autonomy, responsibility, and participation. The dimensions measured in the new instrument are based on previous research and earlier assessment scales, but are more behaviorally specific than those measured in any previous scale. Respondents rate their level of agreement to 15 items describing the presence of the three dimensions in their work environment. The scale can be used to compare individuals within groups, or groups within organizations, to identify individual perceptions and areas for organizational intervention and development.},

abstract = {How do people effectively regulate their emotional reactions? Why are some people better at this than others? Most prior research has addressed these ques- tions by focusing on deliberate forms of emotion regulation. We argue that this focus has left out an important aspect of emotion regulation, namely, automatic emotion regulation (AER). Our review of the behavioral literature suggests that AER is pervasive in everyday life, and has far-reaching consequences for individuals' emotions. However, the behavioral literature has yet to address the mechanisms underlying the observed effects. Because it is difficult to directly measure the processes involved in AER, evidence from neuroscientific studies is particularly helpful in addressing these questions. Our review of the neuroscientific literature suggests distinct neural bases for different types of AER, which provides important clues about the cognitive and behavioral processes that might be involved in AER.},

@article{McEwen2000,
abstract = {The primary hormonal mediators of the stress response, glucocorticoids and catecholamines, have both protective and damaging effects on the body. In the short run, they are essential for adaptation, maintenance of homeostasis, and survival (allostasis). Yet, over longer time intervals, they exact a cost (allostatic load) that can accelerate disease processes. The concepts of allostasis and allostatic load center around the brain as interpreter and responder to environmental challenges and as a target of those challenges. In anxiety disorders, depressive illness, hostile and aggressive states, substance abuse, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), allostatic load takes the form of chemical imbalances as well as perturbations in the diurnal rhythm, and, in some cases, atrophy of brain structures. In addition, growing evidence indicates that depressive illness and hostility are both associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other systemic disorders. A major risk factor for these conditions is early childhood experiences of abuse and neglect that increase allostatic load later in life and lead individuals into social isolation, hostility, depression, and conditions like extreme obesity and CVD. Animal models support the notion of lifelong influences of early experience on stress hormone reactivity. Whereas, depression and childhood abuse and neglect tend to be more prevalent in individuals at the lower end of the socioeconomic ladder, cardiovascular and other diseases follow a gradient across the full range of socioeconomic status (SES). An SES gradient is also evident for measures of allostatic load. Wide-ranging SES gradients have also been described for substance abuse and affective and anxiety disorders as a function of education. These aspects are discussed as important, emerging public health issues where the brain plays a key role. Copyright (C) 2000 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.},

Families were interviewed with the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule − child/parent versions. They reported on the child's anxiety levels using the Revised Childrens Anxiety and Depression Scale − child/parent versions. Children reported on metacognitive beliefs using the Metacognitions Questionnaire for Children − 30 item version. Fourty-four children aged 7–13 years (50{\%} girls) were enrolled, and one family dropped out during treatment. Fifty percent of the children had received counseling or psychological treatment for their anxiety disorder previously. Following treatment, 86.4{\%} of the children were free of their primary disorder and 72.7{\%} were free of all anxiety disorders, the corresponding figures were 75{\%} and 65.9{\%} at 6-months follow-up. The effect sizes were large for all measures and clinically significant improvements were obtained for 70{\%} of the children at posttest and 77{\%} at follow-up.

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that males and females differ in personality and gender differences have also been reported in brain structure. However, effects of gender on this " personality–brain " relationship are yet unknown. We therefore investigated if the neural correlates of personality differ between males and females. Whole brain voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate the influence of gender on associations between NEO FFI personality traits and gray matter volume (GMV) in a matched sample of 182 males and 182 females. In order to assess associations independent of and dependent on gender, personality–GMV relationships were tested across the entire sample and separately for males and females. There were no significant correlations between any personality scale and GMV in the analyses across the entire sample. In contrast, significant associations with GMV were detected for neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness only in males. Interestingly, GMV in left precuneus/parieto-occipital sulcus correlated with all 3 traits. Thus, our results indicate that brain structure–personality relationships are highly dependent on gender, which might be attributable to hormonal interplays or differences in brain organization between males and females. Our results thus provide possible neural substrates of personality–behavior relationships and underline the important role of gender in these associations.},

abstract = {The increasing manufacture and use of products based on nanotechnology raises concerns for both workers and consumers. Various studies report induction of pulmonary inflammation after inhalation exposure to nanoparticles, which can vary in aspects such as size, shape, charge, crystallinity, chemical composition, and dissolution rate. Each of these aspects can affect their toxicity, although it is largely unknown to what extent. The aim of the current review is to analyse published data on inhalation of nanoparticles to identify and evaluate the contribution of their physicochemical characteristics to the onset and development of pulmonary inflammation. Many physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles affect their lung deposition, clearance, and pulmonary response that, in combination, ultimately determine whether pulmonary inflammation will occur and to what extent. Lung deposition is mainly determined by the physical properties of the aerosol (size, density, shape, hygroscopicity) in relation to airflow and the anatomy of the respiratory system, whereas clearance and translocation of nanoparticles are mainly determined by their geometry and surface characteristics. Besides size and chemical composition, other physicochemical characteristics influence the induction of pulmonary inflammation after inhalation. As some nanoparticles dissolve, they can release toxic ions that can damage the lung tissue, making dissolution rate an important characteristic that affects lung inflammation. Fibre-shaped materials are more toxic to the lungs compared to spherical shaped nanoparticles of the same chemical composition. In general, cationic nanoparticles are more cytotoxic than neutral or anionic nanoparticles. Finally, surface reactivity correlates well with observed pulmonary inflammation. With all these characteristics affecting different stages of the events leading to pulmonary inflammation, no unifying dose metric could be identified to describe pulmonary inflammation for all nanomaterials, although surface reactivity might be a useful measure. To determine the extent to which the various characteristics influence the induction of pulmonary inflammation, the effect of these characteristics on lung deposition, clearance, and pulmonary response should be systematically evaluated. The results can then be used to facilitate risk assessment by categorizing nanoparticles according to their characteristics.},

The temperamental trait Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS), which is characterized by increased sensitivity to environmental stimuli (Aron and Aron, 1997) and is related to Neuroticism and Openness (Smolewska et al., 2006), may describe an underlying characteristic more directly associated with 5-HTTLPR genotype. High levels of SPS are found in 15-20{\%} of the population and have in fMRI studies been associated with enhanced neural processing of detailed visual stimuli (Jagiellowicz et al., 2011) and increased neural activation in response to happy and sad faces (Acevedo et al., 2010). Several defining characteristics of SPS, as reflected by items on the self-report questionnaire, are similar to physiological characteristics found in 5-HTTLPR short allele carriers, including increased brain activation in response to emotional stimuli (Canli et al., 2005), increased acoustic startle response (Brocke et al., 2006), and increased cortisol response to social evaluation (Way et al., 2010). High levels of SPS may reflect an endophenotype associated with the 5-HTTLPR short/short genotype. Methods Participants Two-hundred healthy adult individuals (aged 18-88), included in the Cimbi database between 2000 and 2010, completed NEO-PI-R and TCI personality batteries at the time of inclusion. Blood samples were collected and genotypes for the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism determined. In 2010, the cohort (n = 169, 58.6{\%} male) completed the questionnaires Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) Scale and the Symptom Checklist-90R (SCL-90R).},

abstract = {The present article presents and reviews the model of psychopathology and treatment underlying Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). ACT is unusual in that it is linked to a comprehensive active basic research program on the nature of human language and cognition (Relational Frame Theory), echoing back to an earlier era of behavior therapy in which clinical treatments were consciously based on basic behavioral principles. The evidence from correlational, component, process of change, and outcome comparisons relevant to the model are broadly supportive, but the literature is not mature and many questions have not yet been examined. What evidence is available suggests that ACT works through different processes than active treatment comparisons, including traditional Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT). There are not enough well-controlled studies to conclude that ACT is generally more effective than other active treatments across the range of problems examined, but so far the data are promising.},

The present paper endeavors, in two ways, to advance a dialogue between these theoretical viewpoints. At the level of theory, we explore issues for which social-cognitive and dialogical analyses may be mutually complementary. Regarding empirical research, we report novel analyses of a dataset involving idiographic measures of self-knowledge and self-efficacy appraisals. Results of this analysis indicate that variations in the complexity of dialogues in which people describe their personal attributes predict item-to-item statistical variance on a multidomain self-efficacy measure. We conclude with a discussion of how methodological advances may help to link the knowledge structures studied in social-cognitive theory to the discursive processes studied by narrative and dialogical theorists.},

On postpartum day 4, 55 healthy subjects received a brief explanation about HRV biofeedback using a portable device. Among them, 25 mothers who agreed to implement HRV biofeedback at home were grouped as the biofeedback group, and other 30 mothers were grouped as the control group. At 1 month postpartum, there was a significant decrease in total Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score (P {\textless} 0.001) in the biofeedback group; this change was brought about mainly by decreases in items related to anxiety or difficulty sleeping. There was also a significant increase in standard deviation of the normal heartbeat interval (P {\textless} 0.01) of the resting HRV measures in the biofeedback group after adjusting for potential covariates. In conclusion, postpartum women who implemented HRV biofeedback after delivery were relatively free from anxiety and complained less of difficulties sleeping at 1 month postpartum. Although the positive effects of HRV biofeedback may be partly attributable to intervention effects, due to its clinical outcome, HRV biofeedback appears to be recommendable for many postpartum women as a feasible health-promoting measure after childbirth.},

abstract = {PORGES, S. W. Cardiac vagal tone: A physiological index of stress. NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV 19(2) 225-233, 1995.-Cardiac vagal tone is proposed as a novel index of stress and stress vulnerability in mammals. A model is described that emphasizes the role of the parasympathetic nervous system and particularly the vagus nerve in defining stress. The model details the importance of a branch of the vagus originating in the nucleus ambiguus. In mammals the nucleus ambiguus not only coordinates sucking, swallowing, and breathing, but it also regulates heart rate and vocalizations in response to stressors. In mammals it is lpossible, by quantifying the amplitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia, to assess the tonic and phasic regulation of the vagal pathways originating in the nucleus ambiguus. Measurement of this component of vagal tone is proposed as a method to assess, on an individual basis, both stress and the vulnerability to stress. Vagal tone Stress Autonomic nervous system Heart rate Respiratory sinus arrhythmia RESEARCH on stress in adult humans has often focused on the description of events that are considered stressful (e.g., death of a spouse, loss of a job, etc) and not on the functional impact of these events on physiology. In research with adult humans, interview techniques and questionnaires are used to obtain perceptions of ewmts to determine whether they are stressful. With young pre,erbal infants and with other nonver-bal mammals, the evaluation of stress is more difficult and relies on the interpretation of behavioral and physiological reactivity. In the latter populations, the impact of stress is often observed when behavior becomes disorganized (e.g., dis-ruption in movement patterns, irregular sleep-wake patterns, difficulties in regulating behavior in social settings, extended bouts of crying, and general irritability) and homeostatic physiological processes me disrupted (e.g., difficulties in di-gestion and elimination and other problems with autonomic processes). Thus, in contrast to research with the verbal hu-man, in which stress is often treated as a psychological con-struct with a potential physiological correlate, in other mam-malian populations, stress is assumed to be a physiological construct. Unlike the behavioral and psychological emphasis in re-search with adult humans, research with other mammalian populations has focused on the assessments of behavior (e.g., crying and vocalizations) and physiology (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, ACTH, and cortisol) in response to proce-dures that are presumed s{\~{}}essful. In the preverbal infant these procedures include circumcision (38), lumbar puncture (39), cardiac catheterization (3]L), heel lance (15), inoculation (27) and maternal separation (19). It is assumed that global mea-sures of physiological systems reflecting cardiovascular activ-ity and the status of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis will be sensitive to the stressful events not only in infants, but also in other mammals. How these systems register stress or stress vulnerability is seldom discussed. Although there are individual differences in response thresholds (i.e., stress vulnerability) to the identical proce-dures, current definitions of stress emphasize either the treat-ment (e.g., the stressful procedure) or the global behavioral and physiological responses to treatment. They do not empha-size either the neurophysiological mechanisms mediating the response to stressors, or the uniqueness of an individual's re-sponse. The model being presented hypothesizes that neuro-physiological mechanisms promote or limit physiological reac-tivity to presumed stressful events. It is proposed that the status of neurophysiological regulation prior to exposure to a specific stressor would promote or limit physiological reactiv-ity and, thus, the physiological dimension of stress. Based upon this approach, physiological stress is functionally de-fined. The model emphasizes the role of the bralnstem in regulat-ing behavioral and physiological reactivity to stress. The model is based on neurophysiological structures, common to all mammals, that regulate autonomic processes. Specifically, in mammals the nucleus ambiguus provides the motor neu-rons: (a) to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing; and (b) to regulate shifts in heart rate and vocalization fre-quencies in response to stressful events. A method will be described for assessing, on an individual basis, both the stress response and the vulnerability to stress.},

abstract = {Background: The intention-to-treat principle states that all randomised participants should be analysed in their rando-mised group. The implications of this principle are widely discussed in relation to the analysis, but have received limited attention in the context of handling errors that occur during the randomisation process. The aims of this article are to (1) demonstrate the potential pitfalls of attempting to correct randomisation errors and (2) provide guidance on handling common randomisation errors when they are discovered that maintains the goals of the intention-to-treat principle. Methods: The potential pitfalls of attempting to correct randomisation errors are demonstrated and guidance on handling common errors is provided, using examples from our own experiences. Results: We illustrate the problems that can occur when attempts are made to correct randomisation errors and argue that documenting, rather than correcting these errors, is most consistent with the intention-to-treat principle. When a participant is randomised using incorrect baseline information, we recommend accepting the randomisation but recording the correct baseline data. If ineligible participants are inadvertently randomised, we advocate keeping them in the trial and collecting all relevant data but seeking clinical input to determine their appropriate course of management, unless they can be excluded in an objective and unbiased manner. When multiple randomisations are performed in error for the same participant, we suggest retaining the initial randomisation and either disregarding the second randomisation if only one set of data will be obtained for the participant, or retaining the second randomisation otherwise. When participants are issued the incorrect treatment at the time of randomisation, we propose documenting the treatment received and seeking clinical input regarding the ongoing treatment of the participant. Conclusion: Randomisation errors are almost inevitable and should be reported in trial publications. The intention-to-treat principle is useful for guiding responses to randomisation errors when they are discovered.},

We also evaluated areas of both infarct and low blood flow that might have contributed to AOS or impaired vSTM in each person. We found that AOS was associated with tissue dysfunction in motor-related areas (posterior primary motor cortex, pars opercularis; premotor cortex, insula) and sensory-related areas (primary somatosensory cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, parietal operculum/auditory cortex); while impaired vSTM was associated with primarily motor-related areas (pars opercularis and pars triangularis, premotor cortex, and primary motor cortex). These results are consistent with the hypothesis, also supported by functional imaging data, that both speech praxis and vSTM rely on partially overlapping networks of brain regions.},

abstract = {The current study provides the first published evidence that the parasympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system differentiates the response profiles between individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and controls. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a non-invasive marker of the influence of the myelinated vagal fibers on the heart, and heart period were collected during the presentation of film clips of varying emotional content. The BPD and control groups had similar initial levels of RSA and heart period. However, during the experiment the groups exhibited contrasting trajectories, with the BPD group decreasing RSA and heart period and the control group increasing RSA and heart period. By the end of the experiment, the groups differ significantly on both RSA and heart period. The correlation between the changes in RSA and heart period was significant only for the control group, suggesting that vagal mechanisms mediated the heart period responses only in the control group. The findings were consistent with the Polyvagal Theory [Porges, S. W. (1995). Orienting in a defensive world: Mammalian modifications of our evolutionary heritage: A Polyvagal Theory.

ACT appears to be comparable to cognitive therapy in outcomes, but to have greater empirical support for the processes through which it initiates therapeutic improvement. Preliminary findings supportive of ACT in preventing depression when delivered through nontraditional means require validation by comparisons to appropriate control conditions. Component analyses are recommended to substantiate suggestive evidence that ACT may contribute appreciably to the impact of existing treatments for depression and related disorders.},

abstract = {Despite the increased work on leadership in teams, there is a lack of integration concerning the relationship between leader behaviors and team performance outcomes. A framework depicting the relationship between leadership functions, specific leadership behaviors, and conditions which enable team performance was created. Using this framework, a meta-analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between leadership behavior in teams and behaviorally-based team performance outcomes. Results suggest the use of task-focused behaviors is moderately related to perceived team effectiveness and team productivity (.333, .203). Person-focused behaviors were related to perceived team effectiveness (.360), team productivity (.284), and team learning (.560). Sub-group analyses indicated that the specific leadership behaviors investigated were generally related to team performance outcomes. Most notably, empowerment behaviors accounted for nearly 30{\%} of the variance in team learning. Finally, moderator analyses investigating the level of task interdependence were conducted. Study limitations, practical implications, and directions for research are also outlined. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) for depression is a formulation-driven treatment grounded in the Wells and Matthews (Attention and emotion: A clinical perspective, 1994) self-regulatory model. Unlike traditional CBT it does not focus on challenging the content of depressive thoughts or on increasing mastery and pleasure. Instead it focuses on reducing unhelpful cognitive processes and facilitates metacognitive modes of processing. MCT enables patients to interrupt rumination, reduce unhelpful self-monitoring tendencies, and establish more adaptive styles of responding to thoughts and feelings. An important component of treatment is modification of positive and negative metacognitive beliefs about rumination. MCT was evaluated in 6-8 sessions of up to 1 h each across 4 patients with recurrent and/or chronic major depressive disorder. A non-concurrent multiple-baseline with follow-up at 3 and 6 months was used. Patients were randomly allocated to different length baselines and outcomes were assessed via self-report and assessor ratings. Treatment was associated with large and clinically significant improvements in depressive symptoms, rumination and metacognitive beliefs and gains were maintained over follow-up. The small number of cases limits generalisability but continued evaluation of this new brief treatment is clearly indicated.},

In the current study we compared CBT and MCT for heterogeneous anxiety disorders in a residential setting. Ninety patients with a primary diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Social Phobia or Panic disorder, with and without Agoraphobia, were randomized to either CBT or MCT. Patients were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and one-year follow-up. Primary outcome measures were Beck Anxiety Inventory and ADIS IV and secondary outcome measures were SCID II, Beck Depression Inventory, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, The Symptom Checklist-90 and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems–64. Treatment fidelity was satisfactory and therapist credibility was equal in both treatments. There was a significant difference in the level of anxiety favouring MCT at post-treatment (d = 0.7), but there were no differences at one-year follow-up, mainly due to a further improvement in the CBT group during the follow-up period. Both treatments were efficacious. No differences in effect on comorbid diagnoses and symptoms were found, but MCT produced larger change in personality problems. MCT seems to have a more rapid effect on anxiety symptoms, but there were no significant differences in the long term for patients with comorbid anxiety disorders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Web-based cognitive-behavioral therapeutic (CBT) apps have demonstrated efficacy but are characterized by poor adherence. Conversational agents may offer a convenient, engaging way of getting support at any time. OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. METHODS In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, "Depression in College Students," as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). RESULTS Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67{\%} female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93{\%}, 54/58), and Caucasian (79{\%}, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83{\%} (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17{\%} attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants' comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy. CONCLUSIONS Conversational agents appear to be a feasible, engaging, and effective way to deliver CBT.},

abstract = {Objective: Bullying is increasingly conceptualized as strategic behavior motivated by a desire to gain social dominance in the peer group. Cross-sectional research has shown that relative to their peers bullies are higher in social dominance as indexed by resource control, and are often perceived as powerful and "cool." However, research examining the developmental relationship between bullying and resource control is lacking. The present longitudinal study fills this gap in the literature. Method: Using a three wave design, participants (N= 394) were followed from late childhood into early adolescence. Joint trajectory analyses were used to test whether groups with distinct developmental trajectories of bullying and resource control can be identified, and how these trajectories are related. Results: For both bullying and resource control three groups emerged (high, medium, and low), indicating that bullies and social dominants do not constitute one homogeneous group. More intense bullying is associated with higher levels of social dominance. Being consistently high in bullying is almost synonymous with being consistently high in resource control, whereas the reverse is not the case. Conclusions: Findings suggest that high bullying leads to the attainment of high social dominance, and do not support the view that children high in social dominance engage in bullying to maintain their dominant position. Practice implications: This study further underscores the need for interventions targeting mechanisms by which the peer group assigns social dominance to bullies. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Neurons and neural populations do not function as islands onto themselves. Rather, they interact with other such elements through their afferent and efferent connections in an orchestrated manner so as to enable different sensorimotor and cognitive tasks to be performed. The concept of functional connectivity and the allied notion of effective connectivity were introduced to designate the functional strengths of such interactions. Functional neuroimaging methods, especially PET and fMRI, have been used extensively to evaluate the functional connectivity between different brain regions. After providing a brief historical review of these notions of brain connectivity, I argue that the conceptual formulations of functional and effective connectivity are far from clear. Specifically, the terms functional and effective connectivity are applied to quantities computed on types of functional imaging data (e.g., PET, fMRI, EEG) that vary in spatial, temporal, and other features, using different definitions (even for data of the same modality) and employing different computational algorithms. Until it is understood what each definition means in terms of an underlying neural substrate, comparisons of functional and/or effective connectivity across studies may appear inconsistent and should be performed with great caution. Lee et al. (2003), in their accompanying paper, report on the main topics discussed at the recent Workshop on Functional Connectivity, which was organized by Rolf Kotter and Karl Friston and held in D{\"{u}}sseldorf, Germany. The commentary by Lee et al. does an admirable job of describing the main pre-sentations and gives some flavor to the rather extensive dis-cussions that took place. Because clear differences in opinion concerning the nature of anatomic, functional, and effective connectivity were presented by various participants, it seems appropriate that a second view of these terms, particularly functional and effective connectivity, be voiced. My position was that all three types of connectivity that were discussed at the workshop are extremely elusive concepts, 1 and that this},

abstract = {Aims The standardised mean difference (SMD) is one of the most used effect sizes to indicate the effects of treatments. It indicates the difference between a treatment and comparison group after treatment has ended, in terms of standard deviations. Some meta-analyses, including several highly cited and influential ones, use the pre-post SMD, indicating the difference between baseline and post-test within one (treatment group). METHODS In this paper, we argue that these pre-post SMDs should be avoided in meta-analyses and we describe the arguments why pre-post SMDs can result in biased outcomes. RESULTS One important reason why pre-post SMDs should be avoided is that the scores on baseline and post-test are not independent of each other. The value for the correlation should be used in the calculation of the SMD, while this value is typically not known. We used data from an 'individual patient data' meta-analysis of trials comparing cognitive behaviour therapy and anti-depressive medication, to show that this problem can lead to considerable errors in the estimation of the SMDs. Another even more important reason why pre-post SMDs should be avoided in meta-analyses is that they are influenced by natural processes and characteristics of the patients and settings, and these cannot be discerned from the effects of the intervention. Between-group SMDs are much better because they control for such variables and these variables only affect the between group SMD when they are related to the effects of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that pre-post SMDs should be avoided in meta-analyses as using them probably results in biased outcomes.},

abstract = {This article concerns the nature of evoked brain responses and the principles underlying their generation. We start with the premise that the sensory brain has evolved to represent or infer the causes of changes in its sensory inputs. The problem of inference is well formulated in statistical terms. The statistical fundaments of inference may therefore afford important constraints on neuronal implementation. By formulating the original ideas of Helmholtz on perception, in terms of modern-day statistical theories, one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts. It turns out that the problems of inferring the causes of sensory input (perceptual inference) and learning the relationship between input and cause (perceptual learning) can be resolved using exactly the same principle. Specifically, both inference and learning rest on minimizing the brain's free energy, as defined in statistical physics. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. Cortical responses can be seen as the brain's attempt to minimize the free energy induced by a stimulus and thereby encode the most likely cause of that stimulus. Similarly, learning emerges from changes in synaptic efficacy that minimize the free energy, averaged over all stimuli encountered. The underlying scheme rests on empirical Bayes and hierarchical models of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of cortical organization and responses. The aim of this article is to encompass many apparently unrelated anatomical, physiological and psychophysical attributes of the brain within a single theoretical perspective. In terms of cortical architectures, the theoretical treatment predicts that sensory cortex should be arranged hierarchically, that connections should be reciprocal and that forward and backward connections should show a functional asymmetry (forward connections are driving, whereas backward connections are both driving and modulatory). In terms of synaptic physiology, it predicts associative plasticity and, for dynamic models, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. In terms of electrophysiology, it accounts for classical and extra classical receptive field effects and long-latency or endogenous components of evoked cortical responses. It predicts the attenuation of responses encoding prediction error with perceptual learning and explains many phenomena such as repetition suppression, mismatch negativity (MMN) and the P300 in electroencephalography. In psycho-physical terms, it accounts for the behavioural correlates of these physiological phenomena, for example, priming and global precedence. The final focus of this article is on perceptual learning as measured with the MMN and the implications for empirical studies of coupling among cortical areas using evoked sensory responses.},

abstract = {Neuroanatomy places critical constraints on the functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex. To analyze these constraints we have examined the relationship between structural features of networks (expressed as graphs) and the patterns of functional connectivity to which they give rise when implemented as dynamical systems. We selected among structurally varying graphs using as selective criteria a number of global information-theoretical measures that characterize functional connectivity. We selected graphs separately for increases in measures of entropy (capturing statistical independence of graph elements), integration (capturing their statistical dependence) and complexity (capturing the interplay between their functional segregation and integration). We found that dynamics with high complexity were supported by graphs whose units were organized into densely linked groups that were sparsely and reciprocally interconnected. Connection matrices based on actual neuroanatomical data describing areas and pathways of the macaque visual cortex and the cat cortex showed structural characteristics that coincided best with those of such complex graphs, revealing the presence of distinct but interconnected anatomical groupings of areas. Moreover, when implemented as dynamical systems, these cortical connection matrices generated functional connectivity with high complexity, characterized by the presence of highly coherent functional clusters. We also found that selection of graphs as they responded to input or produced output led to increases in the complexity of their dynamics. We hypothesize that adaptation to rich sensory environments and motor demands requires complex dynamics and that these dynamics are supported by neuroanatomical motifs that are characteristic of the cerebral cortex.},

abstract = {This paper picks up from Bynner's recent critique of the current formulation of emerging adulthood as presented in his recent exchange with Arnett in the Journal of Youth Studies (2005, volume 8(4) and 2006, volume 9(1)). It pays particular attention to the exclusion processes in education and the workplace that prevent young people in some socio-economic contexts from experiencing the developmental processes presumed to be of benefit to all 'emerging adults'. In addition, an alternative to Arnett's psychological, free-choice model of emerging adulthood is offered that identifies the social and economic conditions that have produced the prolonged transition to adulthood. We argue that this hiatus in the life-course, which is increasingly referred to as emerging adulthood, can be better explained in terms of changing economic conditions leading to a lowering of the social status of the young that is contributing to increasingly precarious trajectories, and in terms of the decline in the social markers of adulthood associated with the individualization process. When these structural conditions are examined, it appears that Arnett's model 'begs the question' about emerging adulthood (i.e. takes for granted the very thing under contention), and mistakes the coping mechanisms of many young people for freely chosen options to delay their entry into adulthood.

abstract = {The management of school refusal behavior in children and adolescents has long been a nettlesome process for clinicians. However, a functional analytic model of school refusal behavior has been proposed to assist clinicians in organizing, assessing, and treating this heterogeneous population. The present study examined, on a preliminary controlled basis, the treatment utility of this functional model and the School Refusal Assessment Scale (SRAS). Specifically, participants with acute school refusal behavior were initially assigned prescriptive (n = 4) or nonprescriptive (n = 4) treatment from child and parent SRAS ratings. Those receiving nonprescriptive treatment did so in a lagged design prior to prescriptive treatment. Results indicated that nonprescriptive treatment led to worsened percentage of time out of school and daily ratings of anxiety and depression. However, prescriptive treatment substantially ameliorated these problems. In addition, improvements were seen across child self-report measures and parent and/or teacher ratings of internalizing and externalizing behavior. Using a functional model, treatment may thus be assigned efficiently and effectively for this population.},

abstract = {H I G H L I G H T S • Anxiety disorders are mental-health burdens that are sometimes difficult to treat. • Psychodynamic therapy is commonly used to treat anxiety. • Psychodynamic therapies may not differ overall in efficacy from other treatments. • For most disorders investigated, efficacy may continue over a year post-treatment. • Research should identify who may uniquely benefit from psychodynamic therapy. a b s t r a c t Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that psychodynamic therapy (PDT) may be useful in the treatment of anxiety disorders. This paper presents the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date examining the controlled effects of PDT for anxiety disorders. 14 RCTs totaling 1073 patients were included. PDT was found to be significantly more effective than control conditions (g = 0.64). PDT did not differ significantly from alternative treatments at post-treatment (g = 0.02), follow-up (FU) up to a year (g = −0.11), and FU past a year (g = −0.26). Medium-to-high levels of heterogeneity were detected, indicating significant differ-ences between studies. Nevertheless, our findings remained unchanged when heterogeneity outliers were removed (termination g = − 0.06/short FU g = − 0.01/long FU g = − 0.10). Power analyses indicated that large or medium effect size differences between PDT and other active treatments could be detected even with high heterogeneity. Exploratory moderator analyses found few significant predictors of effect (e.g., relative risk of dropout). No differences were found examining remission rates or relative risk of dropout. Overall, PDT was shown to be as efficacious as other active treatments that have been studied for anxiety disorders.},

Results: Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses revealed that the LSAS-SR performed well in identifying participants with social anxiety disorder and generalized social anxiety disorder. Consistent with Mennin et al. 's [2002: J Anxiety Disord 16:661-673] research on the clinician-administered version of the LSAS, cutoffs of 30 and 60 on the LSAS-SR provided the best balance of sensitivity and specificity for classifying participants with social anxiety and generalized social anxiety disorder, respectively. Conclusions: The LSAS-SR may be an accurate and cost-effective way to identify and subtype patients with social anxiety disorder, which could help increase the percentage ofpeople who receive appropriate treatment for this debilitating disorder. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

To this end, our intent is to describe the current state of the science of implementation, and identify what it will take to transmit innovative programs and practices to mental health, social services, juvenile justice, education, early childhood education, employment services, and substance abuse prevention and treatment. This monograph summarizes findings from the review of the research literature on implementation and proposes frameworks for understanding effective implementation processes. The results of this literature review and synthesis confirm that systematic implementation practices are essential to any national attempt to use the products of science - such as evidence-based programs - to improve the lives of its citizens.},

The simulation detailed was developed using data from an 18-month ethnographic case study. The original research, collected in Denver, CO during the 1990s, represents the historic account of users and dealers who operated in the Larimer area heroin market. Working together, the authors studied the behaviors of customers, private dealers, street-sellers, brokers, and the police, reflecting the core elements pertaining to how the market operated. After evaluating the logical consistency between the data and agent behaviors, simulations scaled-up interactions to observe their aggre-gated outcomes. While the concept and findings from this study remain experimental, these methods represent a novel way in which to understand illicit drug markets and the dynamic adaptations and outcomes they generate. Extensions of this research perspective, as well as its strengths and limitations, are discussed.},

@misc{Tudge1996,
abstract = {In this chapter we provide a brief overview of ecological perspectives as they relate to human development, as the background to more extensive discussion of the perspectives taken by two theorists, James Gibson and Urie Bronfenbrenner. Despite their very different foci (Gibson being concerned primarily with perception, Bronfenbrenner with social contexts) and their different levels of analysis, they share basic assumptions and, we shall argue, their perspectives should be viewed as complementary. The assumptions that they share derive from their acceptance of an ecological perspective. What is an ecological perspective? It is a standpoint for conceptualizing the changing maturing person in relation to a changing environment — social, physical, and psychological. The ecological perspective is shared with other frameworks within which human development is considered, ranging from cultural psychology as represented by Shweder (1990), Rogoff (1990), and Valsiner (1989), through the co–constructionist perspective on development (Tudge, Putnam, {\&} Valsiner, in press; Wozniak, 1993), and encompassing developmental psychobiology (Gottlieb, 1992, in press; Johnston, 1985). Although the ecological perspective, and the term ecology, originated (at least in modern day science) in biology, its use spans several disciplines, among which is developmental psychology. There, it is linked most notably to the work of James Gibson and Urie Bronfenbrenner. For both of these theorists an ecological perspective has unique meaning, yet fundamentally they share a belief in the necessity of viewing the individual and the environment as they relate to and define each other. They have built their theories upon this premise.},

abstract = {In the literature, peritraumatic dissociation is frequently considered to be a risk factor for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In the last few years, a large number of studies have investigated the connections between PTSD and peritraumatic dissociation. A meta- analysis was conducted, including 35 empirical studies that discuss the connections between peritraumatic dissociation and PTSD. Meta-analy- sis makes it possible to undertake a systematic integration of findings produced by primary studies of this kind to date. The average effect size was r = 0.36, indicating a significant positive correlation between the two dimensions. In this article, the authors make a distinction between correlate and risk factor. Therefore, subgroup analyses of quasi-prospec- tive and retrospective studies were undertaken with a view to estab- lishing whether peritraumatic dissociation represents a risk factor for the development of PTSD following a traumatic event. The average effect size in the quasi-prospective studies was r = 0.34, which was sig- nificant. From a methodological viewpoint, the results show that peri- traumatic dissociation is a moderate risk factor for PTSD. Nonetheless, the conceptualization of peritraumatic dissociation in the framework of psychotraumatic stress syndromes–is it a predictor, a symptom, or something else entirely?–needs to be addressed by future research.},

abstract = {The brain is capable of massively parallel information pro-cessing while consuming only ∼1–100 fJ per synaptic event 1,2 . Inspired by the eeciency of the brain, CMOS-based neural architectures 3 and memristors 4,5 are being developed for pat-tern recognition and machine learning. However, the volatil-ity, design complexity and high supply voltages for CMOS architectures, and the stochastic and energy-costly switching of memristors complicate the path to achieve the intercon-nectivity, information density, and energy eeciency of the brain using either approach. Here we describe an electrochem-ical neuromorphic organic device (ENODe) operating with a fundamentally diierent mechanism from existing memristors. ENODe switches at low voltage and energy ({\textless}10 pJ for 10 3 µm 2 devices), displays {\textgreater}500 distinct, non-volatile conductance states within a ∼1 V range, and achieves high classification ac-curacy when implemented in neural network simulations. Plas-tic ENODes are also fabricated on flexible substrates enabling the integration of neuromorphic functionality in stretchable electronic systems 6,7 . Mechanical flexibility makes ENODes compatible with three-dimensional architectures, opening a path towards extreme interconnectivity comparable to the human brain. Two-terminal memristors based on filament-forming metal oxides (FFMOs) or phase change memory (PCM) materials have recently been demonstrated to function as non-volatile memory that can emulate neuronal and synaptic functions such as long-term potentiation (LTP), short-term potentiation (STP), and spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) 4,5},

Attachment representations were examined in a normative sample of 97 males and 88 females (mean age = 10.35 years), using an adaptation of the Attachment Doll Story Completion Task. Structural Equation Modeling was used to assess general latent structures of social-information processing (SIP) orientations across the different SIP steps. As expected, secure mother-child attachment representations were positively associated with prosocial SIP orientation and negatively with antisocial SIP orientation. Avoidant attachment was associated negatively with prosocial and distress expression SIP orientations. Ambivalent attachment was positively associated with distress expression SIP orientation. Disorganized attachment was positively associated with SIP distress expression orientation and with antisocial SIP orientation. Results are discussed as reflecting a generalization of social knowledge and regulation strategies from the attachment system to the affiliative system.

The assessments include Promoting the Emergence of Advanced Knowledge Relational Training System (PEAK) and the Verbal Behavior Milestones Assessment and Placement Program (VB-MAPP). Forty students with autism were administered each of the assessments. The results suggest that there was a strong correlation between PEAK total scores and the VB-MAPP ( r = 0.8266, p {\textless} 0.0001), and that a logarithmic regression model provided a good fit for the data ( R = 0.9598). Also, a ceiling effect was observed for the VB-MAPP around a PEAK total score of 138 of 368, suggesting that PEAK may provide a more robust measure of advanced language skills in individuals with autism. The utility of these findings for behavioral clinicians and researchers are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {In this article, the notion of intersubjectivity is reexamined by going back to its original formulation by the philosopher Edmund Husserl at the beginning of the 20th century. On the basis of a careful reading of Husserl's books and lecture notes, four claims are put forward that help clarify in what sense intersubjectivity is a broader and more fundamental notion than currently assumed in the social sciences. In particular, it is argued that for Husserl intersubjectivity is more than shared or mutual understanding and is closer to the notion of the possibility of being in the place where the Other is. Furthermore, intersubjectivity is the source of objectivity and not always or necessarily something to be achieved or negotiated through verbal communication or other means. In fact, in its most basic sense, Husserlian intersubjectivity includes a mode of participation in the natural and material world that does not even require an immediately perceivable human presence. Following this discussion, it is suggested that the full range of meanings of intersubjectivity found in Husserl's writings can be used as the basis for a study of the human condition that has a chance to unite all subfields of anthropology as practiced in the US. With this goal in mind, six related but distinct domains of intersubjectivity are proposed.},

abstract = {Quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) has come a long way in its relatively short life in terms of use in clinical practice. Now, as clinicians become aware of the scientific basis and power of using parametrically based measures of QEEG to assess an individual against age-matched populations, they find new ways to employ this technique. Neurofeedback clinicians are realizing the utility of defining deviations from normal, of clarifying syndromes, and finding heretofore unrecognized etiology as ways of guiding therapeutic interventions. This chapter presents some recent advanced techniques combined with QEEG, which can produce powerful results. The case studies illustrate the methods and some results which can be achieved through use of these multiple applications. There are literally thousands of univariate electrophysiological measures that can be derived, transformed, and normed into Z-scores, to be used to indicate degrees of deviations from normal. The problem confronting the clinician is to realize the meaningfulness of these deviations. One of the advantages of statistical measurement approaches with parametric data is the ability to reduce redundancies by methods of multivariate analyses. This exponentially increases the capacity for discriminative sensitivity in defining behavioral syndromes of specific functional clusters. This is a gigantic step forward in understanding the functional pathology of the patients facing us and, as we gain experiences, will transform the practice of neurofeedback training.},

However, subsequent failures to reproduce the effect heightened scepticism of this claim in the academic community, and effectively led to the disqualification of the subject from further study. Motivated by the possibility that such judgement might have been premature, we embarked on a multi-institution programme to re-evaluate cold fusion to a high standard of scientific rigour. Here we describe our efforts, which have yet to yield any evidence of such an effect. Nonetheless, a by-product of our investigations has been to provide new insights into highly hydrided metals and low-energy nuclear reactions, and we contend that there remains much interesting science to be done in this underexplored parameter space.},

At 10.5 months, infants were assessed experimentally with a gaze-following paradigm. At 2.5 years, children's language skills were measured using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories. At 4.5 years, children's explicit theory of mind was assessed with a standard test battery. Analyses revealed that infants with higher gaze-following scores at 10.5 months produced significantly more mental-state words at 2.5 years and that children with more mental-state words at 2.5 years were more successful on the theory-of-mind battery at 4.5 years. These predictive longitudinal relationships remained significant after controlling for general language, maternal education, and nonsocial attention. The results illuminate the bridging role that language plays in connecting infants' social cognition to children's later understanding of others' mental states. The obtained specificity in the longitudinal relations informs theories concerning mechanisms of developmental change.},

abstract = {Tel.: +44 (0)203 448 4347; Fax: +44 (0)207 813 1445 Abstract: This paper describes a free energy principle that tries to explain the ability of biological systems to resist a natural tendency to disorder. It appeals to circular causality of the sort found in synergetic formulations of selforganization (e.g., the slaving principle) and models of coupled dynamical systems, using nonlinear Fokker Planck equations. Here, circular causality is induced by separating the states of a random dynamical system into external and internal states, where external states are subject to random fluctuations and internal states are not. This reduces the problem to finding some (deterministic) dynamics of the internal states that ensure the system visits a limited number of external states; in other words, the measure of its (random) attracting set, or the Shannon entropy of the external states is small. We motivate a solution using a principle of least action based on variational free energy (from statistical physics) and establish the conditions under which it is formally equivalent to the information bottleneck method. This approach has proved useful in understanding the functional architecture of the brain. The generality of variational free energy minimisation and corresponding information theoretic formulations may speak to interesting applications beyond the neurosciences; e.g., in molecular or evolutionary biology.},

abstract = {Recent research on changing fears has examined targeting reconsolidation. During reconsolidation, stored information is rendered labile after being retrieved. Pharmacological manipulations at this stage result in an inability to retrieve the memories at later times, suggesting that they are erased or persistently inhibited. Unfortunately, the use of these pharmacological manipulations in humans can be problematic. Here we introduce a noninvasive technique to target the reconsolidation of fear memories in humans. We provide evidence that old fear memories can be updated with nonfearful information provided during the reconsolidation window. As a consequence, fear responses are no longer expressed, an effect that lasted at least a year and was selective only to reactivated memories without affecting others. These findings demonstrate the adaptive role of reconsolidation as a window of opportunity to rewrite emotional memories, and suggest a noninvasive technique that can be used safely in humans to prevent the return of fear. Learning about potential dangers in the environment is critical for adaptive function, but at times fear learning can be maladaptive, resulting in excessive fear and anxiety. Research on changing fears has highlighted several techniques, most of which rely on the inhibition of the learned fear response. An inherent problem with these inhibition techniques is that the fear may return, for example with stress 1},

@article{Baltes1997,
abstract = {Drawing on both evolutionary and ontogenetic perspectives, the basic biological-genetic and social-cultural architecture of human development is outlined. Three principles are involved. First, evolutionary selection pressure predicts a negative age correlation, and, therefore, genome-based plasticity and biological potential decrease with age. Second, for growth aspects of human development to extend further into the life span, culture-based resources are required at ever-increasing levels. Third, because of age-related losses in biological plasticity, the efficiency of culture is reduced as life span development unfolds. Joint application of these principles suggests that the life span architecture becomes more and more incomplete with age. Degree of completeness can be defined as the ratio between gains and losses in functioning. Two examples illustrate the implications of the life span architecture proposed. The first is a general theory of development involving the orchestration of 3 component processes: selection, optimization, and compensation. The second considers the task of completing the life course in the sense of achieving a positive balance between gains and losses for all age levels. This goal is increasingly more difficult to attain as human development is extended into advanced old age.},

Using a psychophysical measure (Borg CR100 scale) the present study aimed to further investigate perceptual constancy of happy and angry facial expressions at varied sizes, which is a proxy for varying viewing distances. Seventy-one (42 females) participants rated the intensity and valence of facial expressions varying in distance and intensity. The results demonstrated that the perceived intensity (PI) of the emotional facial expression was dependent on the distance of the face and the person perceiving it. An interaction effect was noted, indicating that close-up faces are perceived as more intense than faces at a distance and that this effect is stronger the more intense the facial expression truly is. The present study raises considerations regarding constancy of the PI of happy and angry facial expressions at varied distances.},

When these ingredients are present there is a psychic shift that allows unacceptable painful feelings to come to the surface. Toward adding further empirical support for the concept, in this article we compare outcomes between patients who experienced one or more major unlocking of the unconscious (N57) to those who did not experi- ence major unlocking (N32) during ISTDP treatment. Significant and widespread differences were seen between these two groups, those with major unlocking had greater symptom reduction, interpersonal gains, and cost reduction for treatment. The relevance of this to clinical practice and healthcare utilization will be discussed.},

Multiple strands of research evidence converge to suggest that affect dysregulation, impulsivity and unstable interpersonal relationships are core features of borderline personality disorder (BPD). The MBT approach to BPD attempts to provide a theoretically consistent way of conceptualising the inter-relationship of these features. Methods: MBT makes mentalizing a core focus of therapy and was initially developed for the treatment of BPD in routine clinical services, delivered in group and individual modalities. This article provides a brief overview of mentalizing and its relevance to BPD, provides an overview of MBT and notes a number of current trends in MBT. Results: MBT provides clinicians with an empirically supported approach to BPD and its treatment. Conclusions: Whilst mentalizing is viewed as an integrative framework for therapy, more knowledge is needed as to which of the therapies are of most benefit for individual patients.

abstract = {Procrastination is a prevalent and pernicious form of self-regulatory failure that is not entirely understood. Hence, the relevant conceptual, theoretical, and empirical work is reviewed, drawing upon correlational, experimental, and qualitative findings. A meta-analysis of procrastination's possible causes and effects, based on 691 correlations, reveals that neuroticism, rebelliousness, and sensation seeking show only a weak connection. Strong and consistent predictors of procrastination were task aversiveness, task delay, self-efficacy, and impulsiveness, as well as conscientiousness and its facets of self-control, distractibility, organization, and achievement motivation. These effects prove consistent with temporal motivation theory, an integrative hybrid of expectancy theory and hyperbolic discounting. Continued research into procrastination should not be delayed, especially because its prevalence appears to be growing.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and predictors of language attainment in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and severe language delay. We hypothesized greater autism symptomatology and lower intelligence among children who do not attain phrase/fluent speech, with nonverbal intelligence and social engagement emerging as the strongest predictors of outcome.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Data used for the current study were from 535 children with ASD who were at least 8 years of age (mean = 11.6 years, SD = 2.73 years) and who did not acquire phrase speech before age 4. Logistic and Cox proportionate hazards regression analyses examined predictors of phrase and fluent speech attainment and age at acquisition, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 372 children (70{\%}) attained phrase speech and 253 children (47{\%}) attained fluent speech at or after age 4. No demographic or child psychiatric characteristics were associated with phrase speech attainment after age 4, whereas slightly older age and increased internalizing symptoms were associated with fluent speech. In the multivariate analyses, higher nonverbal IQ and less social impairment were both independently associated with the acquisition of phrase and fluent speech, as well as earlier age at acquisition. Stereotyped behavior/repetitive interests and sensory interests were not associated with delayed speech acquisition.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that many severely language-delayed children in the present sample attained phrase or fluent speech at or after age 4 years. These data also implicate the importance of evaluating and considering nonverbal skills, both cognitive and social, when developing interventions and setting goals for language development.},

abstract = {This chapter argues for the intellectual and policy benefits of using a different lens through which to understand children's successes and difficulties in classroom and school contexts. Specifically, I consider ways that early learning may be bolstered or constrained not only by early cognitive skill, but also by children's emotional regulatory skills and by the emotional climates of classrooms and schools. The following chapter first explores the key mechanisms by which children develop competent versus compromised emotion regulation, and the ways that children's emotion regulation may, in turn, support versus constrain learning in educational settings. In so doing, it outlines the neurobiological basis for why emotion regulation may matter for both academic and social success in school. It then considers the contexts of school settings from an emotional regulatory perspective, considering the ways that teachers and peers not only provide cognitively oriented instructional inputs but also foster an emotional climate that might be alternately disruptive or supportive of children's emotional and cognitive development. The chapter then highlights ways in which these processes may be particularly important for children facing the substantial risks to school success posed by cumulative exposure to income poverty and the environmental stressors that are associated with economic disadvantage. Finally, it reviews findings from several recent interventions targeting children's ability to modulate their emotions and behavior within classroom contexts. Those findings suggest that our field is at a crossroads where old and new paradigms are able to be integrated in productive ways that have major implications for both basic developmental science and educational intervention.

abstract = {This paper reviews the affective neuroscience dealing with the effects of traumatic events. We give an overview of the normal fear reactions, the pathological fear reaction, and the character of emotional episodic memories. We find that both emotions and emotional memories are a tripartite unit of sensory information, autonomic reaction, and motor impulse (the PRM complex). We propose that emotions and movements are part and parcel of the same complex. This is our main finding from the review of affective neuroscience, and from here we focus on psychotherapy with posttrauma reactions. The finding of the process of memory reconsolidation opens up a new treatment approach: affective psychotherapy focused on reconsolidation. The meaning of reconsolidation is that an emotional memory, when retrieved and being active, will rest in a labile form, amenable to change, for a brief period of time, until it reconsolidates in the memory. This leads us to the conclusion that emotions, affects, must be evoked during the treatment session and that positive emotion must come first, because safety must be part of the new memories. In the proposed protocol of affective psychotherapy based on reconsolidation the emotional episodic memory is relived in a safe and positive setting, focused in turn on the sensory experience, the autonomic reaction, and the motor impulse. Then it is followed by a fantasy of a different positive version of the same event. All in all treatment should provide a series of new memories without fear related to the original event. With the focus on the motor program, and the actions, there is a natural link to art therapy and to the mode of play, which can rehearse and fantasize new positive actions.},

abstract = {Inhibition is a major form of self-regulation. As such, it depends on self-awareness and comparing oneself to standards and is also susceptible to fluctuations in willpower resources. Ego depletion is the state of reduced willpower caused by prior exertion of self-control. Ego depletion undermines inhibition both because restraints are weaker and because urges are felt more intensely than usual. Conscious inhibition of desires is a pervasive feature of everyday life and may be a requirement of life in civilized, cultural society, and in that sense it goes to the evolved core of human nature. Intentional inhibition not only restrains antisocial impulses but can also facilitate optimal performance, such as during test taking. Self-regulation and ego depletion- may also affect less intentional forms of inhibition, even chronic tendencies to inhibit. Broadly stated, inhibition is necessary for human social life and nearly all societies encourage and enforce it.},

Though the combination of school refusal and anxiety in youth has been associated with a host of poor outcomes (Epstein and Sheldon in J Educ Res 95:308–318, 2002. doi:10.1080/00220670209596604; Birmaher et al. in Pediatr Clin North Am 45:1187–1204, 1998. doi:10.1016/S0031-3955(05)70069-9), little is known about youth with anxiety disorders who exhibit school re-luctance. Youth with school refusal actually miss school, whereas youth who are school reluctant may want to avoid school but do attend. It is important to consider emotional and social functioning in youth with school reluctance, given that school reluctance may be common among anxious youth. Additionally, school reluctant youth may still exhibit significantly greater distress despite their school attendance than non-school reluctant youth. This study examined as-sociations among school reluctance, somatic problems, so-cial and emotional functioning, and anxiety severity in a sample of youth diagnosed with one or more anxiety disor-ders. Based on child self-report, school reluctant (SR) chil-dren exhibit greater loneliness and negative affect than their non-school reluctant (NSR) peers. Clinicians rated SR chil-dren as having greater anxiety severity than NSR children based on semi-structured interviews administered to each child. Additionally, SR children have greater somatic prob-lems than NSR children according to parent-report. Results of this study suggest the need for parents, teachers, and clinicians to work together in the treatment of school reluc-tance in children with anxiety disorders.},

This review describes the most common MRT techniques, summarizes recent evidence of their effectiveness in treating anxiety, and explains their rationale and physiological basis. We conclude that although GAD and PD patients may exhibit elevated muscle tension and abnormal autonomic and respiratory measures during laboratory baseline assessments, the available evidence does not allow us to conclude that physiological activation decreases over the course of MRT in GAD and PD patients, even when patients report becoming less anxious.

abstract = {Traditional behavioral genetic studies (e.g., twin, adoption studies) have shown that human personality has moderate to high heritability, but recent molecular behavioral genetic studies have failed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) with consistent effects. The current study adopted a multi-step approach (ANOVA followed by multiple regression and permutation) to assess the cumulative effects of multiple QTLs. Using a system-level (dopamine system) genetic approach, we investigated a personality trait deeply rooted in the nervous system (the Highly Sensitive Personality, HSP). 480 healthy Chinese college students were given the HSP scale and genotyped for 98 representative polymorphisms in all major dopamine neurotransmitter genes. In addition, two environment factors (stressful life events and parental warmth) that have been implicated for their contributions to personality development were included to investigate their relative contributions as compared to genetic factors. In Step 1, using ANOVA, we identified 10 polymorphisms that made statistically significant contributions to HSP. In Step 2, these polymorphism's main effects and interactions were assessed using multiple regression. This model accounted for 15{\%} of the variance of HSP (p,0.001). Recent stressful life events accounted for an additional 2{\%} of the variance. Finally, permutation analyses ascertained the probability of obtaining these findings by chance to be very low, p ranging from 0.001 to 0.006. Dividing these loci by the subsystems of dopamine synthesis, degradation/transport, receptor and modulation, we found that the modulation and receptor subsystems made the most significant contribution to HSP. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of a multi-step neuronal system-level approach in assessing genetic contributions to individual differences in human behavior. It can potentially bridge the gap between the high heritability estimates based on traditional behavioral genetics and the lack of reproducible genetic effects observed currently from molecular genetic studies.

abstract = {This chapter aims to broaden practitioners' understanding of Asperger's syndrome (AS), a disorder along the continuum of autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). AS is becoming a relatively common diagnosis in schoolchildren who are very bright intellectually but totally inept socially. They are usually initially misdiagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This chapter emphasizes how to use neurofeedback (NFB) plus biofeedback (BFB), in conjunction with coaching in learning strategies (metacognition) to address the major symptoms observed in AS. It develops an understanding of how feedback can improve a person's cognitive, emotional, and even physical functioning, and has named this a systems theory of neural synergy (STNS). The name underscores the fact that NFB plus BFB influence dynamic circuits, and emphasizes that no matter where one enters the nervous system with an intervention the larger system adjusts as it seeks a new balance. If the intervention is done correctly, the new equilibrium will bring out the individual's potential. This chapter is divided into four sections. The first section gives a general overview of Asperger's syndrome including background, a historical note, information on prevalence, and a description of symptoms that includes the authors' clinical observations. The second section correlates symptoms with functional neuroanatomy and electroencephalographic (EEG) findings. The third section further highlights brain areas found to be dysfunctional in ASD, and cites research findings for each of seven key regions that are repeatedly found to differ when compared to people with typical development. The fourth section is concerned with intervention. It provides an overview of the use of NFB plus BFB for managing the symptoms of AS. It provides a summary of what to do, and a discussion of why it is effective.},

abstract = {Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for childhood anxiety disorders, approximately 40{\%} of youth remain anxious after treatment. Metacognitive therapy (MCT-c) for children with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has shown promising effects. The present study aimed to examine if CBT and MCT-c show differential effects in children with primary GAD based on baseline characteristics, in a quasi-experimental design. To investigate which treatment is most beneficial for whom, three potential moderators: age, symptom severity, and comorbid social anxiety were examined. Sixty-three children aged 7-14 completed CBT or MCT-c. Participants were assessed before and after treatment. Both CBT and MCT-c were highly effective in treatment of childhood GAD. None of the selected variables significantly moderated treatment outcomes. Subgroups of children with high symptom severity and social anxiety comorbidity showed trends of responding better to CBT. Methodologically stronger studies are needed to facilitate a better adaptation of treatment for children with GAD.},

abstract = {Embodied mirroring is an experiential, relational, body-based technique that offers a different avenue for the therapist and client to unfold therapeutic stuck points. Although applicable to all clients, it can be especially useful with traumatized clients or those with problematic attachment histories. This article explores the theory and mechanisms underlying embodied mirroring including mirror neurons, infant intersubjectivity, affect attunement, and regulation, attachment, and relational dynamics. Ways by which bottom-up therapies such as sensorimotor psychotherapy and accelerated experiential-dynamic psychotherapy are integrated into the embodied mirroring technique will be detailed. A general description will follow of how the therapist consciously, explicitly, and intentionally mirrors a client somatically to promote the therapist's embodiment of the client's experience and foster the emergence of conscious somatic countertransferences. How the therapist mindfully uses conscious somatic countertransferences in the service of the client will be demonstrated in case examples illustrating 3 forms of embodied mirroring: parallel, guided, and self. Ways the embodied mirroring technique promotes client mastery, empowerment, and transformation are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract).},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate moderators and mediators of the effect of an indicated prevention program for eating disorders (ED) on reduction of dysfunctional attitudes and specific ED symptoms. 126 women (M age = 22.3; range 18-33) reporting subthreshold ED symptoms were randomized to the Student Bodies TM+ (SB+) intervention or an assessment-only control condition. Assessments took place at pre-intervention, mid-intervention (mediators), post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up. Mixed effects modeling including all available data from all time points were used for the data analysis. Intervention effects on the reduction of binge rate were weaker for participants with higher baseline BMI and for participants with a lower baseline purge rate. Intervention effects on reduction of eating disorder pathology were weaker for participants with higher baseline purge rate and with initial restrictive eating. No moderators of the intervention effect on restrictive eating were identified. An increase in knowledge mediated the beneficial effect of SB+ on binge rate. The results suggest that different moderators should be considered for the reduction of symptoms and change in attitudes of disturbed eating and that SB+ at least partially operates through psychoeducation.},

abstract = {Depression and anxiety often emerge for the first time during youth. The school environment provides an ideal context to deliver prevention programs, with potential to offset the trajectory towards disorder. The aim of this review was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of randomised-controlled trials of psychological programs, designed to prevent depression and/or anxiety in children and adolescents delivered in school settings. Medline, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for articles published until February 2015. Eighty-one unique studies comprising 31,794 school students met inclusion criteria. Small effect sizes for both depression (g = 0.23) and anxiety (g = 0.20) prevention programs immediately post-intervention were detected. Small effects were evident after 12-month follow-up for both depression (g = 0.11) and anxiety (g = 0.13). Overall, the quality of the included studies was poor, and heterogeneity was moderate. Subgroup analyses suggested that universal depression prevention programs had smaller effect sizes at post-test relative to targeted programs. For anxiety, effect sizes were comparable for universal and targeted programs. There was some evidence that externally-delivered interventions were superior to those delivered by school staff for depression, but not anxiety. Meta-regression confirmed that targeted programs predicted larger effect sizes for the prevention of depression. These results suggest that the refinement of school-based prevention programs have the potential to reduce mental health burden and advance public health outcomes.},

Second, in providing a more comprehensive link between job demands and job performance, the authors examined strain as a mediator of that relationship. Participants were 1,418 Army cadets attending a 35-day assessment center. Survey data were collected on Day 26 of the assessment center and performance ratings were assessed throughout the assessment center period by expert evaluators. Role clarity was found to moderate the job demands-strain relationship. Specifically, cadets experiencing high demands reported less physical and psychological strain when they reported high role clarity. Moreover, psychological strain significantly mediated the demands-performance relationship. Implications are discussed from theoretical and applied perspectives.},

The traditional behavioral account of rule- governed behavior presented some difficulties in describing how these abilities are formed and altered. With the advent of recent findings within the theoretical approach referred to as Relational Frame Theory (RFT), the former difficulties are at present being overcome. RFT is providing a comprehensive understanding of behavioral problems as found in diverse psychopathologies. The present paper addresses first the basic assumptions of RFT in relation to rule-following. Then, the three types of RGB, pliance, tracking and augmenting are presented. Finally, we describe the problems that can emerge from the different types of RGB, with a special emphasis on the role of ineffective augmenting as the basis of those psychological problems characterized by the occurrence of deliberate efforts to avoid certain thoughts, feelings and the like as the primary coping strategy to live which, in turn, produces paradoxical effects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Early attachment relationships are important for children's development of behavioral and physiological regulation strategies. Parasympathetic nervous system activity, indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), is a key indicator of self-regulation, with links to numerous developmental outcomes. Attachment-related changes in and associations between mother and child RSA during the Strange Situation procedure (SSP) can elucidate individual differences in physiological response to stress that are important for understanding the development of and intervention for psychopathology. 

METHODS
A sample of 142 at-risk mothers and preschool-age children participated in the SSP and provided time-synchronized RSA data during the 7 episodes, which included 2 separations and 2 reunions. Attachment classifications were obtained using the Cassidy et al. (1992) coding system. Linear mixed-effects models were constructed to examine attachment-related change in RSA during the SSP and the concordance between mother and child RSA over time. 

RESULTS
Findings demonstrated attachment-related differences in children's RSA. Secure children's RSA was relatively stable over time, whereas insecure-avoidant children showed RSA increases during the first separation and insecure-resistant children's RSA declined across the SSP. Mothers showed RSA withdrawal during separation regardless of child's attachment classification. Mother–child RSA showed a positive concordance that was strongest in the insecure-resistant group, compared with the other groups. 

CONCLUSIONS
Results support attachment theories concerning parasympathetic response to stress and the role of the mother–child relationship in physiological regulation. Our findings advance previous research by focusing on at-risk mother–preschooler dyads within diverse attachment classifications.},

abstract = {Affective cognitive control capacity (e.g., the ability to regulate emotions or manipulate emotional material in the service of task goals) is associated with professional and interpersonal success. Impoverished affective control, by contrast, characterizes many neuropsychiatric disorders. Insights from neuroscience indicate that affective cognitive control relies on the same frontoparietal neural circuitry as working memory (WM) tasks, which suggests that systematic WM training, performed in an emotional context, has the potential to augment affective control. Here we show, using behavioral and fMRI measures, that 20 d of training on a novel emotional WM protocol successfully enhanced the efficiency of this frontoparietal demand network. Critically, compared with placebo training, emotional WM training also accrued transfer benefits to a "gold standard" measure of affective cognitive control-emotion regulation. These emotion regulation gains were associated with greater activity in the targeted frontoparietal demand network along with other brain regions implicated in affective control, notably the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. The results have important implications for the utility of WM training in clinical, prevention, and occupational settings.},

One hundred and one heterogeneous outpatients reporting moderate to severe levels of anxiety or depression were randomly assigned to traditional cognitive therapy (CT) or to ACT. To maximize external validity, the authors utilized very minimal exclusion criteria. Participants receiving CT and ACT evidenced large, equivalent improvements in depression, anxiety, functioning difficulties, quality of life, life satisfaction, and clinician-rated functioning. Whereas improvements were equivalent across the two groups, the mechanisms of action appeared to differ. Changes in "observing" and "describing" one's experiences appeared to mediate outcomes for the CT group relative to the ACT group, whereas "experiential avoidance," "acting with awareness," and "acceptance" mediated outcomes for the ACT group. Overall, the results suggest that ACT is a viable and disseminable treatment, the effectiveness of which appears equivalent to that of CT, even as its mechanisms appear to be distinct. {\textcopyright} 2007 Sage Publications.},

abstract = {Blood level monitoring helps to determine the therapeutic and toxic ranges for anticonvulsants and antidepressants. We investigated initial drug-drug interactions between lamotrigine and sertraline. We report on case histories of two epileptic patients who were initially on lamotrigine and to whom sertraline was added to control psychiatric features. In case 1, a total daily dose of 25 mg sertraline, with nondetectable sertraline and desmethylsertraline blood levels, resulted in a doubling of the lamotrigine blood level with symptoms of toxicity. In case 2, a 25 mg reduction in the total daily dose of sertraline resulted in halving of the lamotrigine blood level even though the lamotrigine dosage was increased by 33{\%}. This shows that sertraline has potent interactions with lamotrigine metabolism. The authors hypothesize that inhibition of glucuronidation is responsible. Clinicians are advised to observe for symptoms of toxicity and to do serial blood levels to monitor this interaction.},

abstract = {The main objectives were to evaluate efficacy and acceptability of a developmentally sensitive cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety-based school refusal in adolescence. Twenty school-refusing adolescents meeting DSM-IV anxiety disorder criteria participated in a non-randomized trial, together with parents and school staff. Outcome was assessed at post-treatment and 2-month follow-up. Treated adolescents showed significant and maintained improvements across primary outcome variables (school attendance; school-related fear; anxiety), with medium to large effect sizes. Half of the adolescents were free of any anxiety disorder at follow-up. Additional improvements were observed across secondary outcome variables (depression; overall functioning; adolescent and parent self-efficacy). The treatment was rated as acceptable by adolescents, parents, and school staff, which may help explain the very low attrition rate. Social anxiety disorder was the most common disorder among adolescents still meeting anxiety disorder criteria at follow-up. Treatment modifications to improve efficacy for school-refusing adolescents presenting with social anxiety disorder are suggested. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Conventional thinking about preventive inter-ventions focuses over simplistically on the ''package'' of activities and/or their educational messages. An alternative is to focus on the dynamic properties of the context into which the intervention is introduced. Schools, communities and worksites can be thought of as complex ecological systems. They can be theorised on three dimensions: (1) their constituent activity settings (e.g., clubs, festivals, assemblies, classrooms); (2) the social networks that con-nect the people and the settings; and (3) time. An inter-vention may then be seen as a critical event in the history of a system, leading to the evolution of new structures of interaction and new shared meanings. Interventions impact on evolving networks of person-time-place interaction, changing relationships, displacing existing activities and redistributing and transforming resources. This alternative view has significant implications for how interventions should be evaluated and how they could be made more effective. We explore this idea, drawing on social network analysis and complex systems theory.},

abstract = {Although the body of evidence showing the effects of psychosocial risks on employees' health and well-being is substantial, effective and sustainable stress prevention remains a thorny and complex issue. Most studies have focused on evaluating the effects of organizational interventions and the results are mixed. Researchers find the evaluation of such actions method- ologically challenging, whereas practitioners often find the development and implementation of such actions a complicated matter. One of the reasons for this mixed impact is the lack of attention to contextual and process issues, namely how, when, and why interventions have their effects on outcomes such as mental health, well-being, and organizational performance. This article aims to help researchers and practitioners to improve the development, implementation, and evaluation of organizational initiatives designed to reduce exposure to stress, and to promote well-being and healthy organiza- tions. The authors review recent developments in the literature on process evaluation and propose examples of broader theoretical frameworks that could be used to improve this area. They articulate the essential elements for developing and bridging gaps between theory, methods, and practice. Throughout, the authors provide recommendations for the content, process, and reporting of research on intervention process evaluation.},

Quantitative analysis of the thickness of the prefrontal cortex revealed a reduced size at all study ages in the cingulate 1 area of the prefrontal cortex and CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus in pre-natally exposed animals compared to controls. At the level of the basolateral amyg-dala, a reduction in the size was observed at PD35 and PD70 in the VPA group. In addition, a reduced thickness was observed in the prelimbic region of the prefrontal cortex in VPA animals at PD35. Interestingly, no differences in cortical thickness were observed between control and VPA animals in the infralimbic region of the prefrontal at any age. Our results suggest that prenatal exposure to VPA differentially alters cortical limbic regions anatomical parameters, with implication in the autistic spec-trum disorder. Synapse 68:468–473,},

As technology advances and an understanding of the complex mechanisms of the brain systems increases, one's quest for inquiry and reasoning for interpretation will be updated. At the present time, LORETA inverse solutions give clinicians a reliable and cost-effective measure to use in a clinical and research setting. When the combination of frequency aberration in localization and value is paired with knowledge of brain structure and function, the investigator can draw conclusions and interpretations based on objective data that is consistent with the presentation of clinical complaints. Of course this is not completely objective, and is greatly dependent upon the knowledge and ability of the investigator. There are many different approaches to interpretation of EEG, QEEG and even LORETA methods. The fundamentals and understanding of the underpinnings of the EEG are required, but standardization of the interpretation to a large part is not even desirable. Because there is an element of science and an element of art in a good EEG interpretation; it is the latter that defies standardization.},

@article{Wells,
abstract = {In this paper a cognitive model of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is described. Evidence for the model is briefly reviewed and the specific form of cognitive therapy (metacognitive therapy) derived from the model is outlined. The model accounts for the disappointing effects of existing cognitive-behavioural treatments of GAD in terms of a failure to focus on key beliefs concerning worry itself. The model asserts that pathological worry in GAD is maintained by positive and negative metacognitive beliefs concerning the advantages and the dangers of worrying. Individuals with GAD tend to use internal information such as a felt sense that they will be able to cope as a signal to terminate worrying. Although worrying is used as a means of coping with anticipated threats, it becomes the object of negative beliefs and appraisals. Several feedback cycles maintain the problem. When worrying is appraised as dangerous anxiety increases and it is difficult for the individual to obtain an internal state signalling that it is safe to stop worrying. Unhelpful behavioural strategies such as avoidance of situations that trigger worry, thought control strategies characterized by a lack of attempts to interrupt ongoing worry sequences, and attempts to suppress thoughts that trigger worrying maintain maladaptive metacognitions and anxiety. Specific strategies for conceptualizing GAD cases, and for modifying key metacognitions are presented.},

METHOD: Thirty-two trainees enrolled in their first year of a UK university doctoral clinical psychology training programme completed an online questionnaire following an eight-week exercise. RESULTS: Findings indicated an endorsement of many previously reported benefits of exercise participation, but also the identification of negative outcomes. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed that outcomes could be grouped into two main thematic domains (individual task outcomes and task organization issues) along with several subordinate themes. CONCLUSION: SP/SR is a useful tool in the development of trainee CBT therapist competences. There has been limited previous recognition of potential negative outcomes from this type of exercise. However, these can provide additional impetus for therapist skill development.},

@incollection{Abbass2014,
abstract = {Background Since the mid-1970s, short-term psychodynamic psychotherapies (STPP) for a broad range of psychological and somatic disorders have been developed and studied. Early published meta-analyses of STPP, using different methods and samples, have yielded conflicting results, although some meta-analyses have consistently supported an empirical basis for STPP. This is an update of a review that was last updated in 2006. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of STPP for adults with common mental disorders compared with wait-list controls, treatments as usual and minimal contact controls in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). To specify the differential effects of STPP for people with different disorders (e.g. depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, mixed disorders and personality disorder) and treatment characteristics (e.g. manualised versus non-manualised therapies). Search methods The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) was searched to February 2014, this register includes relevant randomised controlled trials from The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974-), MEDLINE (1950-) and PsycINFO (1967-). We also conducted searches on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, DARE and Biological Abstracts (all years to July 2012) and all relevant studies (identified to 2012) were fully incorporated in this review update. We checked references from papers retrieved. We contacted a large group of psychodynamic researchers in an attempt to find new studies. Selection criteria We included all RCTs of adults with common mental disorders, in which a brief psychodynamic therapy lasting 40 or fewer hours in total was provided in individual format. Data collection and analysis Eight review authors working in pairs evaluated studies. We selected studies only if pairs of review authors agreed that the studies met inclusion criteria. We consulted a third review author if two review authors could not reach consensus. Two review authors collected data and entered it into Review Manager software. Two review authors assessed and scored risk of bias. We assessed publication bias using a funnel plot. Two review authors conducted and reviewed subgroup analyses. Main results We included 33 studies of STPP involving 2173 randomised participants with common mental disorders. Studies were of diverse conditions in which problems with emotional regulation were purported to play a causative role albeit through a range of symptom presentations. These studies evaluated STPP for this review's primary outcomes (general, somatic, anxiety and depressive symptom reduction), as well as interpersonal problems and social adjustment. Except for somatic measures in the short-term, all outcome categories suggested significantly greater improvement in the treatment versus the control groups in the short-term and medium-term. Effect sizes increased in long-term follow-up, but some of these effects did not reach statistical significance. A relatively small number of studies (N {\textless} 20) contributed data for the outcome categories. There was also significant heterogeneity between studies in most categories, possibly due to observed differences between manualised versus non-manualised treatments, short versus longer treatments, studies with observer-rated versus self report outcomes, and studies employing different treatment models. Authors' conclusions There has been further study of STPP and it continues to show promise, with modest to large gains for a wide variety of people. However, given the limited data, loss of significance in some measures at long-term follow-up and heterogeneity between studies, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, variability in treatment delivery and treatment quality may limit the reliability of estimates of effect for STPP. Larger studies of higher quality and with specific diagnoses are warranted.},

abstract = {We draw upon data from a prospective, longitudinal study to evaluate the role of typically occurring variations in early experience on development from birth to adulthood. Such an evaluation is complex for both methodological and conceptual reasons. Methodological issues include the need to control for both later experience and potentially confounding third variables, such as IQ or temperament. Conceptual complexity derives from the fact that the effects of early experience can be both direct and indirect, can interact with other factors, and because whether an effect is found depends on what early experience and what outcomes are assessed. Even direct effects are probabilistic and are more in evidence with cumulative than with single measures. Often early experience has its effect indirectly by initiating a chain of events, by altering the organism in some way, and/or by promoting the impact of later experience. We provide examples where early experience is moderated and mediated by other factors and where it shows latent effects following developmental change. We illustrate developmental processes through which early experience has its effect and conclude that despite the complexity of development variations in early experience retain a vital place in the study of development. When we began our longitudinal studies in the 1970s there was great skepticism regarding the lasting role for early experience in human development (e.g., Clarke {\&} Clarke, 1976). Early longitudinal work, such as the Fels study, had indeed shown only modest continuity and virtually none from the first 3 years of life to later periods (Kagan {\&} Moss, 1962). This and other findings led Kagan (1984) to argue that life was like a tape recorder with the record button always on, such that new experiences would write over and replace earlier experiences. However, early studies were based on linear, homotypic models of continuity and/or focused on rather robust aspects of cognitive development. The question remained whether more developmentally appropriate assessments, more complex models, and assessments that included social and emotional aspects of development would be more successful.},

In particular, we review established ideas about the nature and purpose of sleep in terms of protoconsciousness and free energy minimization. By combining these theoretical perspectives, we discover answers to some fundamental questions about sleep: for example, why is homeothermy suspended during sleep? Why is sleep necessary? Why are we not surprised by our dreams? What is the role of synaptic regression in sleep? The imperatives for sleep that emerge also allow us to speculate about the functional role of PGO waves and make some empirical predictions that can, in principle, be tested using recent advances in the modeling of electrophysiological data. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Objective: Our aim in this randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effects on global tinnitus severity of 2 Internet-delivered psychological treatments, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), in guided self-help format. Method: Ninety-nine participants (mean age = 48.5 years; 43{\%} female) who were significantly distressed by tinnitus were recruited from the community. Participants were randomly assigned to CBT (n = 32), ACT (n = 35), or a control condition (monitored Internet discussion forum; n = 32), and they were assessed with standardized self-report measures (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Quality of Life Inventory; Perceived Stress Scale; Tinnitus Acceptance Questionnaire) at pre-, posttreatment (8 weeks), and 1-year follow-up. Results: Mixed-effects linear regression analysis of all randomized participants showed significant effects on the primary outcome (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory) for CBT and for ACT compared with control at posttreatment (95{\%} CI [-17.03,-2.94], d = 0.70, and 95{\%} CI [-16.29,-2.53], d = 0.68, respectively). Within-group effects were substantial from pretreatment through 1-year-follow-up for both treatments (95{\%} CI [-44.65,-20.45], d = 1.34), with no significant difference between treatments (95{\%} CI [-14.87, 11.21], d = 0.16). Conclusions: Acceptance-based procedures may be a viable alternative to traditional CBT techniques in the management of tinnitus.

abstract = {Memory consolidation refers to a slow process that stabilises a memory trace after initial acquisition of novel events. The consolidation theory posits that once a memory is stored in the brain, it remains fixed for the lifetime of the memory. However, compelling evidence has suggested that upon recall, memories can re-enter a state of transient instability, requiring further stabilisation to be available once again for recall. Since its rehabilitation in the past ten years, this process of reconsolidation of memory after recall stimulated intense debates in the field of cognitive neuroscience. In this review we compile this plentiful literature with a particular emphasis on some of the key questions that have emerged from the reconsolidation theory. We focus on tracing the characterisation of the boundary conditions that constrain the occurrence of memory reconsolidation. We also discuss accumulating evidence supporting the idea that reconsolidation, as implied by its definition, is not a mere repetition of consolidation. We review seminal studies that uncovered specific mechanisms recruited during reconsolidation that are not always crucially involved in consolidation. We next address the physiological significance of reconsolidation since several lines of evidence support the idea that reconsolidation, as opposed to consolidation, may offer a unique opportunity to update memories. We finally discuss recent evidence for or against the potential that the process of memory reconsolidation offers for ongoing efforts to develop novel strategies to combat pathogenic memories.},

abstract = {Exposure to stress is associated with a wide range of internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescents, including aggressive behavior. Extant research examining mechanisms underlying the associations between stress and youth aggression has consistently identified social information processing pathways that are disrupted by exposure to violence and increase risk of aggressive behavior. In the current study, we use longitudinal data to examine emotion dysregulation as a potential mechanism linking a broader range of stressful experiences to aggressive behavior in a diverse sample of early adolescents (N = 1065). Specifically, we examined the longitudinal associations of peer victimization and stressful life events with emotion dysregulation and aggressive behavior. Structural equation modeling was used to create latent constructs of emotion dysregulation and aggression. Both stressful life events and peer victimization predicted subsequent increases in emotion dysregulation over a 4-month period. These increases in emotion dysregulation, in turn, were associated with increases in aggression over the subsequent 3 months. Longitudinal mediation models showed that emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship of both peer victimization (z = 2.35, p = 0.019) and stressful life events (z = 2.32, p = 0.020) with aggressive behavior. Increasing the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies is an important target for interventions aimed at preventing the onset of adolescent aggressive behavior.},

abstract = {Neuronal dynamics unfolding within the cerebral cortex exhibit complex spatial and temporal patterns even in the absence of external input. Here we use a computational approach in an attempt to relate these features of spontaneous cortical dynamics to the underlying anatomical connectivity. Simulating nonlinear neuronal dynamics on a network that captures the large-scale interregional connections of macaque neocortex, and applying information theoretic measures to identify functional networks, we find structure–function relations at multiple temporal scales. Functional networks recovered from long windows of neural activity (minutes) largely overlap with the underlying structural network. As a result, hubs in these long-run functional networks correspond to structural hubs. In contrast, significant fluctuations in functional topology are observed across the sequence of net-works recovered from consecutive shorter (seconds) time win-dows. The functional centrality of individual nodes varies across time as interregional couplings shift. Furthermore, the transient couplings between brain regions are coordinated in a manner that reveals the existence of two anticorrelated clusters. These clusters are linked by prefrontal and parietal regions that are hub nodes in the underlying structural network. At an even faster time scale (hundreds of milliseconds) we detect individual episodes of inter-regional phase-locking and find that slow variations in the statis-tics of these transient episodes, contingent on the underlying anatomical structure, produce the transfer entropy functional connectivity and simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent correlation patterns observed on slower time scales.},

abstract = {The immediate early genes (IEGs) are activated rapidly and transiently in response to a multitude of stimuli. The zif268 belongs to a category of regulatory IEGs that activate downstream target genes and is considered to be a triggering mechanism to activate the genomic response in neurons. Several studies have shown that zif268 mRNA is upregulated during different forms of associative learning, and following tetanic stimulation that induces long-lasting LTP. To date, there is a general consensus that zif268 activation may constitute a critical mechanism for the encoding of long-lasting memories, however this is based on relatively few studies. Given the fact that zif268 can be activated by a number of different types of stimuli, it becomes important to determine exactly how it may be implicated in memory. Examination of the current literature suggests that zif268 is necessary in the processing of several types of memory, however, it is not entirely clear what aspects of memory zif268 may be implicated in. Here, we review the existing literature and emphasise that understanding the signalling pathways that lead to activation of the IEGs and the downstream targets of these genes will advance our understanding of how functional activation of zif268 may be implicated in processing long-term memories.},

abstract = {r seems to me that there is a weak link in the :hain of reasoning by which we explain experi-mce and behavior, namely, our concept of the stimulus. The aim of this paper is to find out what psychologists mean by the term stimulus, with the hope of deciding what they ought to mean by it. After a short look at the history of the term, I will try to uncover the sources of confusion in modern usage. In the end, perhaps, the concept will be clarified. If not, certain contradictions will have been brought to light. The experimental study of the stimulus began in the eighteenth century, so far as I can tell, with an investigation of the curious things that could be done to make a frog's leg twitch. The experimenters discovered what is now called the nerve-muscle preparation. Galvani and later Volta gave their names to electricity as well as to physiology by their experiments. In the early nineteenth century Johannes Miiller applied these discoveries to the philosophers' problem of the human senses, the gates of knowledge. The nerves of sense, he pointed out, can be excited by a variety of unnatural agen-cies such as electrical current. Since the mind is acquainted only with the qualities specific to the sensory nerves, not with the stimuli, how it gets knowledge of the material world became more puz-zling than ever. Later in the century, Sherrington was to emphasize the extent to which receptors are naturally protected against such irrelevant stimuli by the structural specialization of sense organs. But meanwhile it had been discovered that the skin would yield sensations only at certain discrete points. Here was a fresh puzzle. The separate receptor cells of all the sense organs came to be seen under the microscope, and the punctate character of the sensory process seemed to be established. During all this time, the physical scientists were discovering the laws of energy and triumphantly measuring it in its various forms, electricity, mo-mentum, light, heat, sound, and the results of chem-ical reaction. It became possible to measure certain 1 Presidential Address to the Eastern Psychological Asso-ciation, New York, New York, April 1960. variables of energy at sense organs, at least the simple ones like frequency and amount. Thresh-olds of reportable sensation were established. Fech-ner, following Weber, conceived the grand scheme of a measurement formula for consciousness, relat-ing its judged intensity to a simple variable of the stimulus. Psychophysics was bora. Whatever could be controlled by an experimenter and applied to an observer could be thought of as a stimulus. In the growing science of human psy-chology, it became evident that this was the inde-pendent variable of an experiment, to be isolated and systematically varied. Much more complex things than physical energies could be presented to the sense organs—words for instance. These were also called stimuli, although the stimulus conditions manipulated, recency, frequency, meaningfulness, were vastly different from the variables of the psy-chophysical experiment. In the latter part of the nineteenth century the concept of the reflex arc was applied to the adaptive behavior of animals. It had been thought to ex-plain the strictly mechanical actions of the body ever since Descartes. Reflexes had stimuli. The situations of animals could be systematically altered and the reactions observed. Organisms obviously responded to such stimuli, and the experimenter could apply them more freely than he could venture to do with human beings. To shorten a long story, such experiments came to be merged with human experiments and the outcome was a general stim-ulus-response psychology. This was a great suc-cess, especially in America. But stimuli for animal psychologists were not the same as stimuli for sen-sory physiologists and stimuli were still different for the students of perception and learning. Enough has been said to show that in the twen-tieth century we have inherited a mixed batch of ideas about the stimulus. We constantly use the word but seldom define it. We take it for granted. We have behavior theory in full bloom, and percep-tion theory in ripened complexity, but who ever heard of stimulus theory?

abstract = {Background: According to common practice based on a generally agreed interpretation of Icelandic law on the rights of patients, health care professionals cannot discuss prognosis and treatment with a patient's family without that patient's consent. This limitation poses ethical problems, because research has shown that, in the absence of insight and communication regarding a patient's impending death, patient's significant others may subsequently experience long-term psychological distress. It is also reportedly important for most dying patients to know that health care personnel are comfortable with talking about death and dying. There is only very limited information concerning gender differences regarding death talk in terminal care patients. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of detailed prospective " field notes " from chaplain interviews of all patients aged 30–75 years receiving palliative care and/or with DNR (do not resuscitate) written on their charts who requested an interview with a hospital chaplain during a period of 3 years. After all study patients had died, these notes were analyzed to assess the prevalence of patient-initiated discussions regarding their own impending death and whether non-provocative evocation-type interventions had facilitated such communication. Results: During the 3-year study period, 195 interviews (114 men, 81 women) were conducted. According to the field notes, 80{\%} of women and 30{\%} of men initiated death talk within the planned 30-minute interviews. After evoking interventions, 59{\%} (67/114) of men and 91{\%} (74/81) of women engaged in death talk. Even with these interventions, at the end of the first interview gender differences were still statistically significant (p = 0.001). By the end of the second interview gender difference was less, but still statistically significant (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Gender differences in terminal care communication may be radically reduced by using simple evocation methods that are relatively unpretentious, but require considerable clinical training. Men in terminal care are more reluctant than women to enter into discussion regarding their own impending death in clinical settings. Intervention based on non-provocative evocation methods may increase death talk in both genders, the relative increase being higher for men.},

abstract = {Recent estimates of mental health morbidity among adults reporting same-gender sexual partners suggest that lesbians, gay men, and bisexual individuals may experience excess risk for some mental disorders as compared with heterosexual individuals. However, sexual orientation has not been measured directly. Using data from a nationally representative survey of 2,917 midlife adults, the authors examined possible sexual orientation-related differences in morbidity, distress, and mental health services use. Results indicate that gay–bisexual men evidenced higher prevalence of depression, panic attacks, and psychological distress than heterosexual men. Lesbian–bisexual women showed greater prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder than heterosexual women. Services use was more frequent among those of minority sexual orientation. Findings support the existence of sexual orientation differences in patterns of morbidity and treatment use. Perspectives on the prevalence of mental health disorders and the need for treatment services among lesbians and gay men have undergone remarkable changes over the last century (Bailey, 1999; Friedman, 1999). Although researchers long ago documented that " illness " models (Gonsiorek, 1996) of homosexuality lacked sufficient empirical support for theoretical predictions (Hooker, 1993), there is increasing concern that lesbians and gay men may be at elevated risk for some psychological disorders because of the harmful effects of},

abstract = {There are many examples of clinical and research findings of special significance for the understanding and treatment of pain. For example, neurofeedback (NF) training applied over the frontal cortex has been found to be followed by a change in pain effect as reported by patients with acute or chronic pain syndromes. And this effect correlates with the localization of the unpleasantness of the pain. Using functional MRI techniques, it is revealed that chronic back pain appears in a different part of the brain (prefrontal cortex) than the discomfort of burning a finger, for example. The acute sensory pain of the burned finger appears in the sensory part of the thalamus with projection into the cortical homunculus. That may explain why NF may be successful when applied to the areas of the brain corresponding to the peripheral perception of an acute pain. However, chronic back pain shows up in the prefrontal cortex. By contrast, with the acute pain representation, the chronic pain leaves an imprint in the prefrontal cortex; thus, it seems that the longer the suffering of pain, the more activity in the prefrontal area. QEEG evaluations have provided similar results to fMRIs, and have guided NF practitioners to train the prefrontal cortex in patients who have suffered from chronic pain for a very long time.},

The rationale for attempting to combine these two approaches is first outlined. Subsequently, each of the verbal operants described by Skinner is examined and subjected to a relational frame analysis. In each case, two types of operants are identified; one based on direct contingencies of reinforcement and the other based on arbitrarily applicable relational responding. The latter operants are labeled verbal because they can be distinguished from other forms of social behavior, and they appear to possess the symbolic or referential qualities often ascribed to human language. By applying rela-tional frame theory to Skinner's verbal operants, we aim to contribute towards the development of a modem behavior-analytic research agenda in human language and cognition.},

The methodology employed makes use of hybridized cellular-and agent-automata that allow for representation of co-interaction among fixed and mobile entities in urban settings across multiple scales. Simulations run with the model are based on various hypotheses from gentrification theory and these hypotheses are tested in simulation by running the model through theory-informed scenarios. The usefulness of this scheme is demon-strated through application of the model to a historically under-invested area of Salt Lake City in Utah that is undergoing recent transformation. Our results show that the hybrid approach is useful in representing human behavior in complex adaptive urban systems. Moreover, our model proves to be a useful test-bed for studying gentrification.},

abstract = {Identifying and hiring the highest performers is essential for organizations to remain competitive. Research has provided effective guidelines for this but important aspects of these evidence-based processes have yet to gain acceptance among practitioners. The general aim of this thesis was to help narrowing the gap between research and practice concerning personnel selection decisions. The first study compared the validity estimates of general mental ability (GMA) and the five factor model of personality traits as predictors of job performance, finding that, when the recently developed indirect correction for range restriction was applied, GMA was an even stronger predictor of job performance than previously found, while the predictive validity of the personality traits remained at similar levels. The approach used for data collection and combination is crucial to forming an overall assessment of applicants for selection decisions and has a great impact on the validity of the decision. The second study compared the financial outcomes of applying a mechanical or clinical approach to combining predictor scores. The results showed that the mechanical approach can result in a substantial increase in overall utility. The third study examined the potential influences that practitioners' cognitive decision-making style, accountability for the assessment process, and responsibility for the selection decision had on their hiring approach preferences. The results showed that practitioners scoring high on intuitive decision-making style preferred a clinical hiring approach, while the contextual aspects did not impact practitioners' preferences. While more research may be needed on practitioner preferences for a particular approach, the overall results of this thesis support and strengthen the predictive validity of GMA and personality traits, and indicate that the mechanical approach to data combination provides increased utility for organizations.},

The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data.

Recent studies suggest the involvement of frontal cortical regions in the modulation of amygdala reactivity and the mediation of effective emotion regulation. However, within-subject inter-regional connectivity between amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the context of affect regulation is unknown. Here, using psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we show that activity in specific areas of the frontal cortex (dorsolateral, dorsal medial, anterior cingulate, orbital) covaries with amygdala activity and that this functional connectivity is dependent on the reappraisal task. Moreover, strength of amygdala coupling with orbitofrontal cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex predicts the extent of attenuation of negative affect following reappraisal. These findings highlight the importance of functional connectivity within limbic-frontal circuitry during emotion regulation.},

abstract = {Donald Hebb pioneered many current themes in behavioural neuroscience. He saw psychology as a biological science, but one in which the organization of behaviour must remain the central concern. Through penetrating theoretical concepts, including the "cell assembly," "phase sequence," and "Hebb synapse," he offered a way to bridge the gap between cells, circuits and behaviour. He saw the brain as a dynamically organized system of multiple distributed parts, with roots that extend into foundations of development and evolutionary heritage. He understood that behaviour, as brain, can be sliced at various levels and that one of our challenges is to bring these levels into both conceptual and empirical register. He could move between theory and fact with an ease that continues to inspire both students and professional investigators. Although facts continue to accumulate at an accelerating rate in both psychology and neuroscience, and although these facts continue to force revision in the details of Hebb's earlier contributions, his overall insistence that we look at behaviour and brain together — within a dynamic, relational and multilayered framework — remains. His work touches upon current studies of population coding, contextual factors in brain representations, synaptic plasticity, developmental construction of brain/behaviour relations, clinical syndromes, deterioration of performance with age and disease, and the formal construction of connectionist models. The collection of papers in this volume represent these and related themes that Hebb inspired. We also acknowledge our appreciation for Don Hebb as teacher, colleague and friend.},

For example, the therapist might say, This is a model we use to help understand [depression, anxiety, guilt, etc.]. All of us live in an environment-family, culture, weather, etc. [point to environment on the model]. We are affected by both our current environment [e.g., job and family stress and supports] and our past environments [e.g., whether we have had successes, losses, criticism]. In addition, we each have four aspects to ourself-a biological or physical aspect, feelings, behavior, and thoughts [point to each on the model]. I've drawn lines between these aspects because each of these four parts is connected to the others. They all sit inside our environment and interact with it as well. What we feel is closely connected to our thinking, our behavior, our biology and our environment. [Next, give a personalized example of the model based on the intake information such as the following paragraph]. For example, you told me that some mornings you feel very tired [writ{\`{e}}`tired'' next to physical] and depressed [write depressed next to feelings]. When you are tired and depressed, what is usually going through your mind as you lie in bed? [ Write these words next to thinking.] And when you are feeling and thinking this way, how does your behavior change? [Ask questions to elicit signs of decreased or withdrawn behavior and write these next to the behavior section.] And how do these changes affect your environment [family, job, etc.]? So, as you see, changes in one of these areas affect changes in all of the others. And over time, these effects can build as you go round and round. Does that make sense to you? Now, the good news is that, just as changes in any one of these areas can make you feel worse, changes in any one of these areas can also help you begin to feel better. For example, in the past few weeks, have you ever had the experience of [pick a change most likely for this client, such as a child or job demand when they felt depressed or anxious and yet they were forced to act]? When that happened your environment put pressure on you, your behavior changed. Do you remember any changes in your thinking or mood? How about your energy [a rough measure of biology]? So, as this example shows, if one of these areas change the others can change as well. What we will be doing in this therapy is: first, learning if this model is true for you; and second, figuring out with you what small changes in your thinking, behavior, environment, biology and feelings lead to the biggest improvements in your life. Most clients find this simple model presentation very interesting and often a relief. It seems to provide a relief for clients to see that all their many problem areas (e.g.,},

abstract = {In recent years, behavioral activation approaches have been used to treat individuals with clinical depression. Extension of these strategies toward individuals presenting with coexistent depressive and anxiety symptoms may represent a parsimonious, practical, and time-and cost-effective treatment method. The present study outlines a case in which coexistent anxiety and depressive symptoms predominate, a clinical presentation made somewhat more complex given an Axis III diagnosis of colitis. A brief behavioral activation treatment for depression (BATD) is used to simultaneously incorporate activation and exposure strategies to ameliorate affective symptoms. Following a 10-session treatment protocol, the patient demonstrated notable decreases in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms and increased quality of life. Although these data are preliminary, they suggest some efficacy for BATD as a viable treatment alternative for individuals with a mixed anxiety-depressive disorder presentation.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the most clinically relevant baseline predictors of time to remission for patients with borderline personality disorder. Method: A total of 290 inpatients meet-ing criteria for both the Revised Diagnos-tic Interview for Borderlines and DSM-III-R for borderline personality disorder were assessed during their index admission with a series of semistructured interviews and self-report measures. Diagnostic sta-tus was reassessed at five contiguous 2-year time periods. Discrete survival ana-lytic methods, which controlled for base-line severity of borderline psychopathol-ogy and time, were used to estimate hazard ratios. Results: Eighty-eight percent of the pa-tients with borderline personality disor-der studied achieved remission. In terms of time to remission, 39.3{\%} of the 242 pa-tients who experienced a remission of their disorder first remitted by their 2-year follow-up, an additional 22.3{\%} first remitted by their 4-year follow-up, an ad-ditional 21.9{\%} by their 6-year follow-up, an additional 12.8{\%} by their 8-year fol-low-up, and another 3.7{\%} by their 10-year follow-up. Sixteen variables were found to be significant bivariate predictors of ear-lier time to remission. Seven of these re-mained significant in multivariate analy-ses: younger age, absence of childhood sexual abuse, no family history of sub-stance use disorder, good vocational record, absence of an anxious cluster per-sonality disorder, low neuroticism, and high agreeableness. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that prediction of time to remis-sion from borderline personality disorder is multifactorial in nature, involving fac-tors that are routinely assessed in clinical practice and factors, particularly aspects of temperament, that are not.},

abstract = {A cognitive model of panic is described. Within this model panic attacks arc said to result from the catastrophic misinterpretation of certain bodily sensations. The sensations which are misinterpreted are mainly those involved in normal anxiety responses (e.g. palpitations, breathlessness. dizziness etc.) but also include some other sensations. The catastrophic misinterpretation involves perceiving these sensations as much more dangerous than they really are (e.g. perceiving palpitations as evidence of an impending heart attack). A review of the literature indicates that the proposed model is consistent with the major features of panic. In particular, it is consistent with the nature of the cognitive disturbance in panic patients, the perceived sequence of events in an attack, the occurrence of 'spontaneous' attacks, the role of hyperventilation in attacks, the effects of sodium lactate and the literature on psychological and pharmacological treatments. Finally, a series of direct tests of the model are proposed.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, experimental and longitudinal research has shown that psychological flexibility is an important determinant of mental health and behavioral effectiveness in the workplace. These findings have been established using a general measure of this psychological process, the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire—Revised (AAQ-II). Consistent with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) theory, psychological flexibility may demonstrate even stronger associations with variables related to a work context (e.g., job satisfaction) if it were assessed using a measure of the construct that is tailored to the workplace. To test this hypothesis, we first developed such a measure, the Work-related AAQ (WAAQ). Findings from 745 participants across three studies reveal that the structure, validity and reliability of the WAAQ are satisfactory. As predicted, the WAAQ, in comparison to the AAQ-II, correlates significantly more strongly with work-specific variables. In contrast, the AAQ-II tends to correlate more strongly with outcomes that are likely to be more stable across different contexts (e.g., mental health and personality variables). These findings are discussed in relation to ACT theory.},

abstract = {Hippocampal place cells undergo remapping when the environment is changed. The mechanism of hippocampal remapping remains elusive but spatially modulated cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) have been identified as a possible contributor. Using pharmacogenetic and optogenetic approaches, we tested the role of MEC cells by examining in mice whether partial inactivation in MEC shifts hippocampal activity to a different subset of place cells with different receptive fields. The pharmacologically selective designer Gi-protein-coupled muscarinic receptor hM4D or the light-responsive microbial proton pump archaerhodopsin (ArchT) was expressed in MEC, and place cells were recorded after application of the inert ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) or light at appropriate wavelengths. CNO or light caused partial inactivation of the MEC. The inactivation was followed by substantial remapping in the hippocampus, without disruption of the spatial firing properties of individual neurons. The results point to MEC input as an element of the mechanism for remapping in place cells.},

Treatment was based on a metacognitive theory of mechanisms by which natural traumatic processing is enabled or hindered by coping strategies. It suggests that elimination of worry/rumination, of maladaptive attention strategies, and enhancing metacognitive flexibility, will permit natural processing and a return to normal cognition. An A-B direct replication series (n=6) with follow-up assessments at 3, 6, and 18-41 months was implemented. Treatment commenced 3-10 months post-trauma. All patients showed large and statistically significant improvements in general emotion and specific PTSD measures. Gains were maintained at follow-up. Two further consecutively referred patients were treated at 8 and 12 months post-trauma to add to sample size (n=8). Overall Post treatment effect sizes were large, ranging from 3.0 to 5.0.

In the context of a positive coordinated therapeutic relationship, the authors detail an experiential process in which the dyadic regulation of painful emotion naturally culminates in the emergence of positive affects and positive emotional states, which, in turn, are vehicles for accessing the emotional resources associated with resilient functioning and emotional flourishing. Detailed transcripts from 2 videotaped sessions are microanalyzed to delineate the moment-to-moment phenomenology and dynamics of the AEDP therapeutic process and to document the spontaneous emergence of these positive affective phenomena in a context designed to make the most of their therapeutic effectiveness.

abstract = {The aim of our meta-analysis was to review the evidence base for the efficacy and safety of antipsychotic and antidepressant combinations in the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses. Randomized controlled trials comparing the combination of antidepressants and antipsychotics with antipsychotics alone for patients with pronounced negative symptoms in schizophrenia were searched for by accessing the register of randomized controlled trials of the Cochrane Schizophrenia group. The studies identified were independently inspected and their quality assessed by two reviewers. The principal outcome of interest was the reduction of negative symptoms. Dichotomous data were analyzed using the relative risk and continuous data were analyzed using standardized mean differences, both specified with 95{\%} confidence intervals. It was possible to include seven trials (n = 202) examining antidepressants as add-on to antipsychotics in this review. Except for one study, all included studies used first generation antipsychotics. While there was often merely a trend in favour of augmentation of antipsychotics with antidepressants in the small single studies, the meta-analytic combination resulted in a statistically significant superiority in the outcome reduction of negative symptoms as a whole. Statistically significant differences between groups in terms of specific subscores of the SANS were found, but the results were inconsistent. The combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants may be more effective in treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia than antipsychotics alone, but this finding needs to be corroborated by further large trials. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Here we investigated whether language-based activation of visual representations can affect the ability to simply detect the presence of an object. We used continuous flash suppression to suppress visual awareness of familiar objects while they were continuously presented to one eye. Participants made simple detection decisions, indicating whether they saw any image. Hearing a verbal label before the simple detection task changed performance relative to an uninformative cue baseline. Valid labels improved performance relative to no-label baseline trials. Invalid labels decreased performance. Labels affected both sensitivity (d') and response times. In addition, we found that the effectiveness of labels varied predictably as a function of the match between the shape of the stimulus and the shape denoted by the label. Together, the findings suggest that facilitated detection of invisible objects due to language occurs at a perceptual rather than semantic locus. We hypothesize that when information associated with verbal labels matches stimulus-driven activity, language can provide a boost to perception, propelling an otherwise invisible image into awareness.},

Separate dimensions were needed to account for the structure of the assertiveness questionnaire across the Mexican and Spanish samples.

abstract = {Team-based structures have become more widely used in organizations. Therefore, it is important for team members to perform well in their current team and to build skills and enthusiasm for working on future teams. This study examined team debriefing, an intervention in which team members reflect on recent experiences to prepare for subsequent tasks. Prior researchers have shown that facilitated team debriefs work, but they have not examined how to enable teams to conduct their own debriefs or studied howdebriefs affect individual level outcomes. Therefore, we compared 2 team-led debriefing techniques: (a) an unguided debrief and (b) a guided debrief designed to incorporate lessons learned from prior debriefs. We collected data from 174 business students who were members of 35 teams from 9 sections of a Strategic Management course. Class sections were randomly assigned to one of the debriefing conditions, and teams completed 4 business cases over 10weeks.Amultilevel design was employed and a multistage model building approach was used to test the hypotheses using hierarchical linear modeling techniques. Results of this cluster randomized, quasi-experimental design suggest that the team-led guided debrief intervention resulted in superior team processes as compared to the unguided debriefing method. Team processes, in turn, related significantly to greater team performance and increased individual readiness for teamwork and enthusiasm for teaming. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper describes a protocol for induction of moderate psychological stress in a laboratory setting and evaluates its effects on physiological responses. The 'Trier Social Stress Test' (TSST) mainly consists of an anticipation period (10 min) and a test period (10 min) in which the subjects have to deliver a free speech and perform mental arithmetic in front of an audience. In six independent studies this protocol has been found to induce considerable changes in the concentration of ACTH, cortisol (serum and saliva), GH, prolactin as well as significant increases in heart rate. As for salivary cortisol levels, the TSST reliably led to 2- to 4-fold elevations above baseline with similar peak cortisol concentrations. Studies are summarized in which TSST-induced cortisol increases elucidated some of the multiple variables contributing to the interindividual variation in adrenocortical stress responses. The results suggest that gender, genetics and nicotine consumption can influence the individual's stress responsiveness to psychological stress while personality traits showed no correlation with cortisol responses to TSST stimulation. From these data we conclude that the TSST can serve as a tool for psychobiological research.},

abstract = {Not only do anxiety and depression diagnoses tend to co-occur, but their symptoms are highly correlated. Although a plethora of research has examined longitudinal associations between anxiety and depression, these data have not yet been effectively synthesized. To address this need, the current study undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of 66 studies involving 88,336 persons examining the prospective relationship between anxiety and depression at both symptom and disorder levels. Using mixed-effect models, results suggested that all types of anxiety symptoms predicted later depressive symptoms (r ϭ .34), and all types of depressive symptoms predicted later anxiety symptoms (r ϭ .31). Although anxiety symptoms more strongly predicted depressive symptoms than vice versa, the difference in effect size for this analysis was very small and likely not clinically meaningful. Additionally, all types of diagnosed anxiety disorders predicted all types of later depressive disorders (OR ϭ 2.77), and all depressive disorders predicted later anxiety disorders (OR ϭ 2.73). Most anxiety and depressive disorders predicted each other with similar degrees of strength, but depressive disorders more strongly predicted social anxiety disorder (OR ϭ 6.05) and specific phobia (OR ϭ 2.93) than vice versa. Contrary to conclusions of prior reviews, our findings suggest that depressive disorders may be prodromes for social and specific phobia, whereas other anxiety and depressive disorders are bidirectional risk factors for one another. Public Significance Statement This meta-analysis suggests that anxiety and depression symptoms bidirectionally prospectively predict one another with moderate and similar strength. These prospective bidirectional relationships are stronger over shorter time periods and weaken over longer time periods. Most anxiety and depressive disorders significantly bidirectionally prospectively predicted one another with strong nonsignificantly different strength. However, depressive disorders more strongly predicted social and specific phobia than vice versa, suggesting that depressive disorders may be prodromes for social and specific phobia.},

In this paper, we present a new formalization of affordances that provides a framework for ro-bot control, learning and planning. We argue that affordances, as relations within the robot-environment system, can be learned by the ro-bot from its interactions with the environment. The interaction is represented as a nested triple of the form (effect, (entity, behavior)) indicat-ing that the behavior applied in an environment perceived as the entity, would produce a perceiv-able effect. The robot accumulates such triples of raw sensory-motor data from different interac-tions and learns the affordance relations through the formation of equivalence classes. We present three studies that implement certain aspects of the formalism on a mobile robot moving in an environment that contains different types of ob-jects. These studies respectively explore (1) the perceptual learning of affordances, (2) the de-velopment of goal-directed behaviors from a set of primitive ones through the learning of affor-dances, and (3) the use of learned affordance re-lations in planning.},

However, current diagnostic approaches in psychopathology are primarily atheoretical, emphasizing description over etiological mechanisms. We describe the importance of Polyvagal Theory toward understanding the etiology of emotion dysregulation, a hallmark of psychopathology. When combined with theories of social reinforcement and motivation, Polyvagal Theory specifies etiological mechanisms through which distinct patterns of psychopathology emerge. In this paper, we summarize three studies evaluating autonomic nervous system functioning in children with conduct problems, ages 4–18. At all age ranges, these children exhibit attenuated sympathetic nervous system responses to reward, suggesting deficiencies in approach motivation. By middle school, this reward insensitivity is met with inadequate vagal modulation of cardiac output, suggesting additional deficiencies in emotion regulation. We propose a biosocial developmental model of conduct problems in which inherited impulsivity is amplified through social reinforcement of emotional lability.

abstract = {Metacognitive therapy (MCT) is based on over 25 years of research focusing on the processes that contribute to the development and maintenance of psychological disorders. The approach identifies a common set of processes in psychopathology, and MCT shows promising results in effectively treating a range of disorders. This paper presents the central theoretical tenets of MCT and uses a clinical vignette to illustrate the structure and techniques of treatment based on Wells's (2009) manual as they relate to a specific case of generalized anxiety disorder. What Is Metacognition and Why Is It Important? This paper provides a general introduction to the theory of metacognitive therapy (MCT) and a more specific outline of how to use MCT for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), illustrated with the clinical case of William. In the final part of the paper the scientific evidence for MCT in GAD is presented. MCT was developed to address the control of cognition and the strategies and knowledge that govern thinking. It contrasts significantly with the theory and focus of standard CBT. Metacognition refers to cognition applied to cognition and may be defined as any knowledge or cognitive processes involved in the appraisal, control, and monitoring of thinking (Flavell, 1979). In short, metacognition is thinking about thinking. Metacognitive theory has distinguished between metacognitive knowledge, which is information that individuals have about their own thinking and about strategies that affect it, and metacognitive regulation, which are the strategies used to change the nature of processing. In the metacognitive theory of psychological disorder (Wells, 2009; Wells {\&} Matthews, 1994), metacognition is central in determining the maintenance and control of negative and biased thinking styles. According to Wells, most people have negative thoughts and beliefs and in most cases these thoughts and beliefs are transitory mental experiences. The negative thoughts become a problem because of the way an individual responds to them. Thus, an important tenet of metacognitive therapy, and one of the features distinguish-ing it from traditional CBT, is that neither the content nor the subjective validity of thoughts and beliefs are the central source of disorder. In basic terms, according to metacogni-tive theory, an individual's metacognitions monitor and control their responses to thoughts, which cause persistence or perseveration of ideas and maintain psychological and interpersonal problems. This supposition can be clearly illustrated in the situation of GAD, where the content of worry shifts around. The content of worry in GAD is not dissimilar from everyday worries experienced by most people. However, people with GAD experience their worry as uncontrollable and excessive, and it is associated with marked distress. The metacognitive model provides an explanation of this in terms of differences in the way individuals relate to, appraise, and control their worry The theoretical grounding of MCT is the Self-Regulatory Executive Function Model (S-REF), which emphasizes the similarities in maladaptive cognitive processing across all psychological disorders (Wells, 2000, 2009; Wells {\&} Matthews, 1994, 1996). The S-REF model postulates a thinking style called the cognitive attentional syndrome (CAS). In MCT the CAS is a universal feature of psychiatric disorders and is responsible for prolonging and intensifying distressing emotions. The CAS is a thinking pattern of inflexible self-focused attention (the focus is on self--observation and monitoring of thought processes), persev-erative thinking (in the form of worry and rumination), threat monitoring, and coping behaviors that backfire and},

To the extent that a scientist embraces both of these as a unified and generally applicable criterion for science, certain philosophical and theoretical practices are counterproductive, including mentalism in both its metaphysical and metatheoretical forms. It is possible and often worthwhile to recast some mentalistic talk into an issue of behavior-behavior relations. When behavior-behavior relations are approached non-mechanistically, however, analysis cannot stop at the level of the relations themselves.

abstract = {—Goal-setting theory is summarized regarding the effectiveness of specific, difficult goals; the relationship of goals to affect; the mediators of goal effects; the relation of goals to self-efficacy; the moderators of goal effects; and the generality of goal effects across people, tasks, coun-tries, time spans, experimental designs, goal sources (i.e., self-set, set jointly with others, or assigned), and dependent variables. Recent studies concerned with goal choice and the factors that influence it, the function of learning goals, the effect of goal framing, goals and affect (well-being), group goal setting, goals and traits, macro-level goal setting, and conscious versus subconscious goals are described. Suggestions are given for future research. KEYWORDS—goal setting; self-efficacy; commitment; sub-conscious goals Goal-setting theory (Locke {\&} Latham, 1990, 2002) was devel-oped inductively within industrial/organizational (I/O) psy-chology over a 25-year period, based on some 400 laboratory and field studies. These studies showed that specific, high (hard) goals lead to a higher level of task performance than do easy goals or vague, abstract goals such as the exhortation to ''do one's best.'' So long as a person is committed to the goal, has the re-quisite ability to attain it, and does not have conflicting goals, there is a positive, linear relationship between goal difficulty and task performance. Because goals refer to future valued out-comes, the setting of goals is first and foremost a discrepancy-creating process. It implies discontent with one's present con-dition and the desire to attain an object or outcome. Goals are related to affect in that goals set the primary stan-dard for self-satisfaction with performance. High, or hard, goals are motivating because they require one to attain more in order to be satisfied than do low, or easy, goals. Feelings of success in the workplace occur to the extent that people see that they are able to grow and meet job challenges by pursuing and attaining goals that are important and meaningful. There are four mechanisms or mediators of the relationship between goals and performance. High goals lead to greater effort and/or persistence than do moderately difficult, easy, or vague goals. Goals direct attention, effort, and action toward goal-relevant actions at the expense of nonrelevant actions. Because performance is a function of both ability and motivation, goal effects also depend upon having the requisite task knowledge and skills. Goals may simply motivate one to use one's existing ability, may auto-matically ''pull'' stored task-relevant knowledge into awareness, and/or may motivate people to search for new knowledge. The latter is most common when people are confronted by new, com-plex tasks. As we will show, such searches may or may not be successful. Goals, in conjunction with self-efficacy (task-specific con-fidence; Bandura, 1997), often mediate or partially mediate the effects of other potentially motivating variables, such as per-sonality traits, feedback, participation in decision making, job autonomy, and monetary incentives. The key moderators of goal setting are feedback, which people need in order to track their progress; commitment to the goal, which is enhanced by self-efficacy and viewing the goal as im-portant; task complexity, to the extent that task knowledge is harder to acquire on complex tasks; and situational constraints. With regard to the latter, Brown, Jones, and Leigh (2005) found that role overload (excess work without the necessary resources to accomplish a task) moderates goal effects; goals affected performance only when overload was low. Goal-setting theory has high internal and external validity. As of 1990, support for goal-setting effects had been found on more than 88 different tasks, involving more than 40,000 male and female participants in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America (Locke {\&} Latham, 1990). Goal effects have been found in both laboratory and field settings, using both correlational and experimental designs and numerous dependent variables. Time spans have ranged from 1 minute to 25 years and effects have been obtained at the individual, group, and organizational-unit levels. Goals are effective even when they come from different sources; they can be assigned by others, they can be set jointly through participation, and they can be self-set. In the latter instance, goals are a key element in self-regulation. Goal theory},

abstract = {Dialectical Behaviour therapy (DBT) was originally developed for the treatment of women diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) in the community. Since then DBT has been modified and evaluated for use with comorbid disorders, across the lifespan and across a range of clinical settings. The DBT model assumes that individuals with BPD lack key interpersonal, self-regulation, and distress tolerance skills, and that personal and environmental factors may frequently block and/or inhibit the use of behavioural skills or reinforce maladaptive actions. DBT is based on an assumption of a pervasive skills deficit; thus the therapy is designed to facilitate the learning of new skills, the embedding of these skills into the individual's repertoire, and the generalization of these skills across contexts. DBT incorporates a range of change-enhancing strategies interwoven with acceptance-focused strategies. DBT was developed from the cognitive-behavioural model of treatment, and thus shares many of its key components. DBT incorporates the principles of dialectics, mindfulness, and validation with cognitive-behavioural principles and techniques. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lincoln2017,
abstract = {Although numerous interventions are available for negative symptoms, outcomes have been unsatisfactory with pharmacological and psychological interventions producing changes of only limited clinical significance. Here, we argue that because negative symptoms occur as a complex syndrome caused and maintained by numerous factors that vary between individuals they are unlikely to be treated effectively by the present "one size fits all" approaches. Instead, a well-founded selection of those interventions relevant to each individual is needed to optimize both the efficiency and the efficacy of existing approaches. The concept of functional analysis (FA) can be used to structure existing knowledge so that it can guide individualized treatment planning. FA is based on stimulus-response learning mechanisms taking into account the characteristics of the organism that contribute to the responses, their consequences and the contingency with which consequences are tied to the response. FA can thus be flexibly applied to the level of individual patients to understand the factors causing and maintaining negative symptoms and derive suitable interventions. In this article we will briefly introduce the concept of FA and demonstrate-exemplarily-how known psychological and biological correlates of negative symptoms can be incorporated into its framework. We then outline the framework's implications for individual assessment and treatment. Following the logic of FA, we argue that a detailed assessment is needed to identify the key factors causing or maintaining negative symptoms for each individual patient. Interventions can then be selected according to their likelihood of changing these key factors and need to take interactions between different factors into account. Supplementary case vignettes exemplify the usefulness of functional analysis for individual treatment planning. Finally, we discuss and point to avenues for future research guided by this model.},

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a novel treatment program, Dialectical Behavior Therapy for School Refusal (DBT-SR), that attempts to address limitations in both existing treatment models and current delivery systems. DBT-SR employs a multimodal approach to directly address the severe emotional and behavioral dysregulation mechanisms maintaining school refusal behavior. It also incorporates a web-based coaching component to provide active, real-time skills coaching to youth and parents at the times, and in the context, of greatest need (at home, during morning hours). A pilot trial and illustrative case examples provide "proof of concept" that DBT-SR is reasonably feasible and acceptable to clients and therapists and that web-based coaching provides incremental, unique benefit. Significant development remains, as participant recruitment proved a challenge in this trial. However, results suggest that DBT-SR is a promising, novel intervention that deserves further development.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in how organizational-level occupational health interventions aimed at improving psychosocial working conditions and employee health and well-being may be planned, implemented and evaluated. It has been claimed that such interventions have the best chance of achieving a significant impact if they follow an intervention process that is structured and also includes the participation of employees. This paper provides an overview of prominent European methods that describe systematic approaches to improving employee health and well-being through the alteration of the way in which work is designed, organized and managed. The methods identified are the Risk Management approach and the Management Standards from Great Britain, the German Health Circles approach, Work Positive from Ireland and Prevenlab from Spain. Comparative analyses reveal that these methods all consist of a five-phase process and that they share a number of core elements within these phases. However, overall the five methods have not been thoroughly validated. To examine the validity of the core elements, we review them in the light of current research in order to support their appropriateness in conducting organizational-level occupational health interventions. Finally, we discuss where we still need more research to determine the working ingredients of organizational-level occupational health interventions.

abstract = {In society today, there is a tendency towards over-diagnosing. This tendency in society at large seems to reflect the normalization of a diagnostic culture. Some researchers have claimed that this normalization could be defined as the 'medicalization of childhood'. There would seem to be a need for a sociocultural analysis of this phenomenon in schools – and it is in relation to this background that the present study hopes to generate new knowledge for the research field. This article explores how professionals in student welfare teams relate to and use neuropsychiatric diagnoses. The study draws on interviews with key officials working in student welfare teams in three urban secondary schools in southern Sweden. The main aim has been to investigate how the school officials talk about diagnoses such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder, and what kind of explanatory value is awarded to these diagnoses. The results indicate that the professional culture in schools plays a key role in how diagnoses are integrated or not integrated into the schools' work with students' behavioural problems. The results also show that the narratives about diagnoses were framed by ideas related to the students' social-class background and gender.},

abstract = {Background: In humans and macaques, a promoter polymorphism that decreases transcription of the serotonin transporter gene is associated with anxiety. Serotonin transporter gene disruption in rodents produces anxious animals with exaggerated limbic– hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (LHPA) responses to stress. We wanted to determine whether serotonin transporter gene promoter variation (rh-5HTTLPR) and rearing condition would interact to influence endocrine responses to stress in infant rhesus macaques. Methods: Animals were reared with their mothers (MR, n ϭ 141) or in peer-only groups (PR, n ϭ 67). At 6 months of age, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels were determined at baseline and during separation stress. Serotonin transporter genotype (l/l and l/s) was determined with polymerase chain reaction followed by gel electrophoresis. Results: Cortisol levels increased during separation, and there was a main effect of rearing condition, with decreased cortisol levels among PR macaques. Animals with l/s rh5-HTTLPR genotypes had higher ACTH levels than did l/l animals. Adrenocorticotropic hormone levels increased during separation, and there was a separation ϫ rearing ϫ rh5-HTTLPR interaction, such that PR-l/s animals had higher ACTH levels during separation than did other animals studied. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that serotonin transporter gene variation affects LHPA axis activity and that the influence of rh5-HTTLPR on hormonal responses during stress is modulated by early experience.},

abstract = {Ten experiments were designed to explore the levels of processing framework for human memory research proposed by Craik and Lockhart (1972). The basic notions are that the episodic memory trace may be thought of as a rather auto- matic by-product of operations carried out by the cognitive system and that the durability of the trace is a positive function of "depth" of processing, where depth refers to greater degrees of semantic involvement. Subjects were induced to process words to different depths by answering various questions about the words. For example, shallow encodings were achieved by asking questions about type- script; intermediate levels of encoding were accomplished by asking questions about rhymes; deep levels were induced by asking whether the word would fit into a given category or sentence frame. After the encoding phase was completed, subjects were unexpectedly given a recall or recognition test for the words. In general, deeper encodings took longer to accomplish and were associated with higher levels of performance on the subsequent memory test.Also, questions lead-ing to positive responses were associated with higher retention levels than questions leading to negative responses, at least at deeper levels of encoding.Further experiments examined this pattern of effects in greater analytic detail. It was established that the original results did not simply reflect differential encod- ing times; an experiment was designed in which a complex but shallow task took longer to carry out but yielded lower levels of recognition than an easy, deeper task.Other studies explored reasons for the superior retention of words associated with positive responses on the initial task. Negative responses were remembered as well as positive responses when the questions led to an equally elaborate encoding in the two cases. The idea that elaboration or "spread" of encoding provides a better description of the results was given a further boost by the finding of the typical pattern of results under intentional learning conditions, and where each word was exposed for 6 sec in the initial phase. While spread and elaboration may indeed be better descriptive terms for the present findings, retention depends critically on the qualitative nature of the encoding operations performed; a minimal semantic analysis is more beneficial than an extensive structural analysis.Finally, Schulman{\&}apos;s (1974) principle of congruity appears necessary for a complete description of the effects obtained. Memory performance is enhanced to the extent that the context, or encoding question, forms an integrated unit with the word presented.A congruous encoding yields superior memory performance because a more elaborate trace is laid down and because in such cases the struc- ture of semantic memory can be utilized more effectively to facilitate retrieval. The article concludes with a discussion of the broader implications of these data and ideas for the study of human learning and memory,},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The contributions of disorder severity, comorbidity and interpersonal variables to therapists' adherence to a cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) manual were tested. METHOD Thirty-eight patients received panic control therapy (PCT) for panic disorder. Trained observers watching videotapes of the sixth session of a 24-session protocol rated therapists' adherence to PCT and their use of interventions from outside the CBT model. Different observers rated patients' behavioural resistance to therapy in the same session using the client resistance code. Interview measures obtained before treatment included the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, the anxiety disorders interview schedule for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV and the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV, Axis II. Questionnaire measures were the anxiety sensitivity index at intake, and, at session 2, the therapist and client versions of the working alliance inventory-short form. RESULTS The higher the patients' resistance and the more Axis II traits a patient had, the less adherent the therapist. Moreover, the more resistant the client, the more therapists resorted to interventions from outside the CBT model. Stronger therapist and patient alliance was also generally related to better adherence, but these results were somewhat inconsistent across therapists. Pretreatment disorder severity and comorbidity were not related to adherence. CONCLUSIONS Interpersonal variables, particularly behavioural resistance to therapy, are related to therapists' ability to adhere to a treatment manual and to their use of interventions from outside of the CBT model. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE Patients' behavioural resistance to therapy may make it more difficult for cognitive-behavioural clinicians to adhere to a structured treatment protocol and more likely for them to borrow interventions from outside the CBT model. Patients' Axis II traits may make adherence to treatment CBT protocol more difficult, although whether this is true varies across therapists. Therapists' adherence to a structured protocol and borrowing from outside of the CBT model do not appear to be affected by disorder severity or Axis I comorbidity.},

abstract = {Psychodynamic therapy (PDT) is an umbrella concept for treatments that operate on an interpretive-supportive continuum and is frequently used in clinical practice. The use of any form of psychotherapy should be supported by sufficient evidence. Efficacy research has been neglected in PDT for a long time. In this review, we describe methodological requirements for proofs of efficacy and summarise the evidence for use of PDT to treat mental health disorders. After specifying the requirements for superiority, non-inferiority, and equivalence trials, we did a systematic search using the following criteria: randomised controlled trial of PDT; use of treatment manuals or manual-like guidelines; use of reliable and valid measures for diagnosis and outcome; adults treated for specific mental problems. We identified 64 randomised controlled trials that provide evidence for the efficacy of PDT in common mental health disorders. Studies sufficiently powered to test for equivalence to established treatments did not find substantial differences in efficacy. These results were corroborated by several meta-analyses that suggest PDT is as efficacious as treatments established in efficacy. More randomised controlled trials are needed for some mental health disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Furthermore, more adequately powered equivalence trials are needed.},

abstract = {There is a widely shared consensus that charismatic–transformational leadership is a particularly effective formof leadership. In a critical assessment of the state-of-the-science in this area of research, we question the validity of that conclusion. We identify four problems with theory and research in char- ismatic–transformational leadership. First, a clear conceptual definition of charismatic–transformational leadership is lacking. Current theories advance multi-dimensional conceptualizations of charismatic–transformational lea- dership without specifying how these different dimensions combine to form charismatic–transformational leadership, or how dimensions are selected for inclusion or exclusion. Second, theories fail to sufficiently specify the causal model capturing how each dimension has a distinct influence on mediating processes and outcomes and how this is contingent on moderating influences. Third, conceptualization and operationalization confounds charismatic–transformational leadership with its effects. Fourth, the most frequently used measurement tools are invalid in that they fail to reproduce the dimensional structure specified by theory and fail to achieve empirical distinctiveness from other aspects of leadership. Given that these problems are fundamental and inherent in the approaches analyzed, it is recommended that current approaches be abandoned, and that the field forego the label of charismatic– transformational leadership in favor of the study of more clearly defined and empirically distinct aspects of leadership.},

abstract = {In this paper, we set out to develop a theoretical and conceptual framework for the new field of Radical Embodied Cognitive Neuroscience. This framework should be able to integrate insights from several relevant disciplines: theory on embodied cognition, ecological psychology, phenomenology, dynamical systems theory, and neurodynamics. We suggest that the main task of Radical Embodied Cognitive Neuroscience is to investigate the phenomenon of skilled intentionality from the perspective of the selforganization of the brainbodyenvironment system, while doing justice to the phenomenology of skilled action. In previous work, we have characterized skilled intentionality as the organism's tendency toward an optimal grip on multiple relevant affordances simultaneously. Affordances are possibilities for action provided by the environment. In the first part of this paper, we introduce the notion of skilled intentionality and the phenomenon of responsiveness to a field of relevant affordances. Second, we use Friston's work on neurodynamics, but embed a very minimal version of his Free Energy Principle in the ecological niche of the animal. Thus amended, this principle is helpful for understanding the embeddedness of neurodynamics within the dynamics of the system " brainbodylandscape of affordances. " Next, we show how we can use this adjusted principle to understand the neurodynamics of selective openness to the environment: interacting actionreadiness patterns at multiple timescales contribute to the organism's selective openness to relevant affordances. In the final part of the paper, we emphasize the important role of metastable dynamics in both the brain and the brainbodyenvironment system for adequate affordanceresponsiveness. We exemplify our integrative approach by presenting research on the impact of Deep Brain Stimulation on affordance responsiveness of OCD patients.},

abstract = {Objectives: To explore psychological factors associated with emotional eating and obesity in a sample of overweight and obese adults attending a weight management programme. Design: A cross-sectional quantitative research design. Methods: Participants (n = 97) completed the Emotional Eating Subscale of the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, the Attitude towards Emotional Expression (AEE) scale and the mindful awareness observe subscale of the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills scale. Clinical measures of body mass index (BMI) were also recorded. Results: Regression analyses revealed that AEE was a significant predictor of emotional eating ($\beta$ = 0.59, p = .000). Control, the belief that emotions should be controlled ($\beta$ = 0.39, p = .026) and the response to eat to diffuse emotion ($\beta$ = 0.37, p = .045) were statistically significant predictors of BMI. Mediation analyses revealed that mindful awareness skills had a significant indirect effect on the relationship between AEE and emotional eating. Conclusions: Findings highlight the influence of AEE on emotional eating and body weight, thereby helping to validate recent developments in an affect phobia model of emotional eating. The authors highlight the prevalence of emotional eating in overweight and obese adults. The potential preventative role of mindful awareness skills may be limited. Validation of the model may be a useful framework for the development and implementation of future weight management interventions. ARTICLE HISTORY},

abstract = {The concepts of attachment and attachment behavior are considered from an ethological-evolutionary viewpoint. Attachment behavior and explora- tion are viewed in balance, and the biological functions of each are dis- cussed. As an illustration of these concepts, a study is reported of 56 white, middle-class infants, 49-51 weeks of age, in a strange situation. The pres- ence of the mother was found to encourage exploratory behavior, her ab- sence to depress exploration and to heighten attachment behaviors. In sep- aration episodes such behaviors as crying and search increased. In reunion episodes proximity-seeking and contact-maintaining behaviors were height- ened. In a substantial proportion of Ss, contact-resisting behaviors were also heightened in the reunion episodes, usually in conjunction with contact- maintaining behaviors, thus suggesting ambivalence. Some Ss also displayed proximity-avoiding behavior in relation to the mother in the reunion epi- sodes. These findings are discussed in the context of relevant observational, clinical, and experimental studies of human and nonhuman primates, in- cluding studies of mother-child separation. In conclusion, it is urged that the concepts of attachment and attachment behavior be kept broad enough to comprehend the spectrum of the findings of this range of studies.},

@article{Thirus2016a,
abstract = {AbstrAct The current study investigated the effects of Relational Frame Theory (RFT) based training on mathematical and logical skills. A sample of 21 Swedish high school students attending first grade and second grade were assigned to either training (n= 10) or no-training conditions (n= 11). Measures of performance on mathematical tests, Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM), and relational responding tasks were taken prior to and after training. For 8-10 weeks, the experimental group trained using SMART, an online multiple exemplar training program for enhancing relational skills. No significant differences between the groups were found on mathematical performance. A significant increase on SPM performance was observed for the experimental group. The findings are in line with previous research on RFT, suggesting that behaviorally based interventions can enhance intellectual performance. Population characteristics, SMART training procedures, strengths and methodological limitations are discussed. Scientific and technological achievements of nations are to a large extent dependent on mathematical abilities. Mathematical abilities are assumed to be of great importance with respect to societal development (Butterworth, Varma, {\&} Laruillard, 2011) and longitudinal data show that mathematical skills are the strongest predictor for later school achievement (Duncan, Dowsett, Claessens, et al., 2007). The present study aimed to investigate a novel intervention procedure for strengthening such skills.},

abstract = {Early-onset disorders (e.g., conduct problems, autism) show a marked male preponderance, whereas adolescent-onset disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety) show a marked female preponderance. A developmental psychopathology framework provides a means to investigate complex gender-related etiologies of these different disorders. This review focuses on biological and environmental factors implicated in the development of conduct problems and depression in boys and girls. Boys and girls showed certain differences in types, rates, comorbidities, antecedents, correlates, and trajectories of these problems. Origins of male and female preponderant problems are likely to be rooted, in part, in biological, physical, cognitive, and social-emotional differences in boys and girls that can precede the expression of clinical problems. These male-like and female-like characteristics are considered regarding conduct problems and depression to explore how they inform biological and environmental theories about gender and psychopathology. At the same time, because boys and girls also show many similarities, it is important to avoid sex-stereotyping mental health problems.},

abstract = {Context: Major depressive disorder in adolescents is common and impairing. Efficacious treatments have been developed, but little is known about longer-term outcomes, including recurrence. Objectives: To determine whether adolescents who responded to short-term treatments or who received the most efficacious short-term treatment would have lower recurrence rates, and to identify predictors of recovery and recurrence. Design: Naturalistic follow-up study. Setting: Twelve academic sites in the United States. Participants: One hundred ninety-six adolescents (86 males and 110 females) randomized to 1 of 4 short-term interventions (fluoxetine hydrochloride treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy, their combination, or placebo) in the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study were followed up for 5 years after study entry (44.6{\%} of the original Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study sample). Main Outcome Measures: Recovery was defined as absence of clinically significant major depressive disorder symptoms on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version interview for at least 8 weeks, and recurrence was defined as a new episode of major depressive disorder following recovery. Results: Almost all participants (96.4{\%}) recovered from their index episode of major depressive disorder during the follow-up period. Recovery by 2 years was significantly more likely for short-term treatment responders (96.2{\%}) than for partial responders or nonresponders (79.1{\%}) (P{\textless}.001) but was not associated with having received the most efficacious short-term treatment (the combination of fluoxetine and cognitive behavioral therapy). Of the 189 participants who recovered, 88 (46.6{\%}) had a recurrence. Recurrence was not predicted by full short-term treatment response or by original treatment. However, full or partial responders were less likely to have a recurrence (42.9{\%}) than were non-responders (67.6{\%}) (P=.03). Sex predicted recurrence (57.0{\%} among females vs 32.9{\%} among males; P=.02). Conclusions: Almost all depressed adolescents recovered. However, recurrence occurs in almost half of recovered adolescents, with higher probability in females in this age range. Further research should identify and address the vulnerabilities to recurrence that are more common among young women. {\textcopyright}2011 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

Study 2 adminis-tered an improved multiple-exemplar-based relational frame training intervention to 8 children with a range of educational and behavioral difficulties. In 7 of the 8 cases, full-scale IQ as measured by the WISC (IV-UK) rose by at least 1 SD; the improvement was statistically sig-nificant at the group level.

abstract = {Von Economo's neurons (VENs) are large, bipolar or corkscrew-shaped neurons located in layers III and V of the frontoinsular and the anterior cingulate cortices. VENs are reported to be altered in pathologies such as frontotemporal dementia and autism, in which the individual's self control is seriously compromised. To investigate the role of VENs in the active human brain, we have explored the functional connectivity of brain areas containing VENs by analyzing resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in 20 healthy volunteers. Our results show that cortical areas containing VENs form a network of frontoparietal functional connectivity. With the use of fuzzy clustering techniques, we find that this network comprises four sub-networks: the first network cluster resembles a "saliency detection" attentional network, which includes superior frontal cortex (Brodmann's Area, BA 10), inferior parietal lobe, anterior insula, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; the second cluster, part of a "sensory-motor network", comprises the superior temporal, precentral and postcentral areas; the third cluster consists of frontal ventromedial and ventrodorsal areas constituted by parts of the "anterior default mode network"; and the fourth cluster encompasses dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal, and superior frontal (BA 10) areas, resembling the anterior part of the "dorsal attentional network". Thus, the network that emerges from analyzing functional connectivity among areas that are known to contain VENs is primarily involved in functions of saliency detection and self-regulation. In addition, parts of this network constitute sub-networks that partially overlap with the default mode, the sensory-motor and the dorsal attentional networks.},

abstract = {This article explores the possibility that romantic love is an attachment process--a biosocial process by which affectional bonds are formed between adult lovers, just as affectional bonds are formed earlier in life between human infants and their parents. Key components of attachment theory, developed by Bowlby, Ainsworth, and others to explain the development of affectional bonds in infancy, were translated into terms appropriate to adult romantic love. The translation centered on the three major styles of attachment in infancy--secure, avoidant, and anxious/ambivalent--and on the notion that continuity of relationship style is due in part to mental models (Bowlby's "inner working models") of self and social life. These models, and hence a person's attachment style, are seen as determined in part by childhood relationships with parents. Two questionnaire studies indicated that relative prevalence of the three attachment styles is roughly the same in adulthood as in infancy, the three kinds of adults differ predictably in the way they experience romantic love, and attachment style is related in theoretically meaningful ways to mental models of self and social relationships and to relationship experiences with parents. Implications for theories of romantic love are discussed, as are measurement problems and other issues related to future tests of the attachment perspective.},

abstract = {Effectiveness of psychotherapeutic treatment Decades of research compellingly demonstrate that when aligned with a wise, skillful, sound provider, clients entering psychotherapeutic treatments can expect to reduce symptoms, accelerate natural healing processes, improve life functioning, and learn additional coping strategies. Those who seek therapy consistently have better outcomes than those who do not receive treatment (or who are on a waitlist) and a broad range of therapies have been shown to assist patients make changes that are both statistically and clinically meaningful in relatively short periods of time. For many clinical disorders, about 50{\%} of all patients return to normal functioning in 10 to 20 sessions. An additional 25 percent of patients experience substantial improvement when dosage levels are increased to 30 to 50 sessions. With the exception of disorders that tend to recur (e. g., addiction disorders), the benefits from treatment appear to be durable as the results of follow-up studies suggest that the effects of treatment last for at least one to five years subsequent to treatment. These results seem at least partially attributable to the emphasis and efforts that psychotherapists make to provide more than support. Personality changes and reorganization of the self often occur. Changes appear to be due to factors common across theory-based treatments rather than to specific unique treatment methods.},

abstract = {Mirror neuron research has come a long way since the early 1990s, and many theorists are now stressing the heterogeneity and complexity of the sensorimotor properties of fronto-parietal circuits. However, core aspects of the initial 'mirror mechanism' theory, i.e. the idea of a symmetric encapsulated mirroring function translating sensory action perceptions into motor formats, still appears to be shaping much of the debate. This article challenges the empirical plausibility of the sensorimotor segregation implicit in the original mirror metaphor. It is proposed instead that the teleological organization found in the broader fronto-parietal circuits might be inherently sensorimotor. Thus the idea of an independent 'purely perceptual' goal understanding process is questioned. Further, it is hypothesized that the often asymmetric, heterogeneous and contextually modulated mirror and canonical neurons support a function of multisensory mapping and tracking of the perceiving agents affordance space. Such a shift in the interpretative framework offers a different theoretical handle on how sensorimotor processes might ground various aspects of intentional action choice and social cognition. Mirror neurons would under the proposed "social affordance model" be seen as dynamic parts of larger circuits, which support tracking of currently shared and competing action possibilities. These circuits support action selection processes-but also our understanding of the options and action potentials that we and perhaps others have in the affordance space. In terms of social cognition 'mirror' circuits might thus help us understand not only the intentional actions others are actually performing-but also what they could have done, did not do and might do shortly.},

abstract = {Clarity and conciseness often go hand in hand: writing that focuses directly on a point and maximizes meaning with minimum wordiness tends to be both clear and concise. Revising for clarity of meaning often makes prose more concise and vice versa. This handout offers tips for keeping academic writing clear and concise. Express actions in verbs (avoid nominalization) Consider this sentence: Original: The cause of our schools's failure at teaching basic skills is not understanding the influence of cultural background on learning. The central verb in the sentence is is—a verb that doesn't pack much punch. The sentence abounds with actions much more interesting than being, but they're not expressed as verbs: the nouns cause, failure, influence, and learning imply the verbs to cause, to fail, to influence, and to learn. Actions expressed in nouns rather than verbs are called nominalizations. (For example, the word nominalization is the noun form of the verb to nominalize.) We can't eliminate nominalizations altogether, nor would we want to. However, letting verbs express actions usually makes sentences more dynamic, direct, clear, and concise: Revised: Our schools have failed to teach basic skills because educators do not understand how cultural backgrounds influence learning.},

abstract = {Aims Anxiety and depression are highly prevalent in people with diabetes (PwD). The most widely used psychological model to explain anxiety and depression in PwD is the Common-Sense Model, which gives a central role to illness perceptions. The Self-Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model proposes metacognitive beliefs are key to understanding the development and maintenance of emotional disorders. To test the potential utility of the S-REF model in PwD, the study explored if metacognitive beliefs explained additional variance in anxiety and depression after controlling for demographic and illness perceptions. Methods 614 adults with either Type 1 (n = 335) or Type 2 (n = 279) diabetes participated in a cross sectional online survey. All participants completed questionnaires on anxiety, depression, illness perceptions and metacognitive beliefs. Results Regression analyses showed that metacognitive beliefs were associated with anxiety and depression in PwD and explained additional variance in both anxiety and depression after controlling for demographics and illness perceptions. Conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate that metacognitive beliefs are associated with anxiety and depression in PwD. The clinical implications of the study are illustrated.},

Unemployed persons reported high levels of stress, while the retired reported low levels. All associations were indepen-dent of one another and of race/ethnicity. Although minorities generally reported more stress than Whites, these differences lost significance when adjusted for the other demographics. Stress increased little in response to the 2008–2009 economic downturn, except among middle-aged, college-educated White men with full-time employment.

Methods: This study was a 12 week, randomized trial of O3 versus placebo and IF-PEP versus active monitoring (AM) using a 2 {\textperiodcentered} 2 design (O3 + PEP: n = 5; O3 + AM: n = 5; placebo + PEP: n = 7; placebo + AM: n = 6). Twenty-three youth ages 7–14 with BP-NOS or CYC were recruited via community advertisements and clinician referrals. Participants could be taking stable medication for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and sleep aids, but no other psychotropics. Independent evaluators assessed participants at screen, baseline, and 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 weeks. Primary outcome measures were the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders (K-SADS) Depression (KDRS) and Mania (KMRS) Rating Scales, Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R), and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). O3/placebo conditions were double-blind; independent evaluators were blind to psychotherapy condition. Results: Most participants (83{\%}) completed the 12 week trial. Side effects were uncommon and mild. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated significant improvement in depressive symptoms (KDRS) for combined treatment relative to placebo and AM (p = 0.01, d = 1.70). Across groups, manic symptoms improved over time without significant treatment effects. Effect of IF-PEP on child depression compared with AM was medium (d = 0.63, CDRS-R) to large (d = 1.24, KDRS). Effect of O3 on depression was medium (d = 0.48, KDRS).},

abstract = {Qualitative research may seem unscientific and anecdotal to many medical scientists. However, as the critics of evidence based medicine are quick to point out, medicine itself is more than the application of scientific rules. 1 Clinical experience, based on personal observation, reflection, and judgment, is also needed to translate scientific results into treatment of individual patients. 2 Personal experience is often characterised as being anecdotal, ungeneralisable, and a poor basis for making scientific decisions. However, it is often a more powerful persuader than scientific publication in changing clinical practice, 3-5 as illustrated by the occasional series "A patient who changed my practice" in the BMJ. 6 In an attempt to widen the scope of evidence based medicine, recent workshops have included units on other subjects, including economic analysis and qualitative research. 7 However, to do so is to move beyond the discipline of clinical epidemiology that underpins evidence based medicine. Qualitative research, in particular, addresses research questions that are different from those considered by clinical epidemiology. Qualitative research can investigate practi-tioners' and patients' attitudes, beliefs, and preferences, and the whole question of how evidence is turned into practice. The value of qualitative methods lies in their ability to pursue systematically the kinds of research questions that are not easily answerable by experimental methods. We use the example of asthma treatment to illustrate how qualitative methods can broaden the scope of evidence based medicine. Although there is consensus over evidence based practice in the treatment of asthma, 8 questions remain about general practitioners' use of clinical guidelines and patients' use of prescribed medication. 9},

abstract = {Background: Theory and research suggest that sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), found in roughly 20{\%} of humans and over 100 other species, is a trait associated with greater sensitivity and responsiveness to the environment and to social stimuli. Self-report studies have shown that high-SPS individuals are strongly affected by others' moods, but no previous study has examined neural systems engaged in response to others' emotions. Methods: This study exam-ined the neural correlates of SPS (measured by the standard short-form Highly Sensitive Person [HSP] scale) among 18 participants (10 females) while viewing photos of their romantic partners and of strangers displaying positive, negative, or neutral facial expressions. One year apart, 13 of the 18 participants were scanned twice. Results: Across all conditions, HSP scores were associated with increased brain activation of regions involved in attention and action planning (in the cingulate and premotor area [PMA]). For happy and sad photo condi-tions, SPS was associated with activation of brain regions involved in awareness, integration of sensory information, empathy, and action planning (e.g., cingu-late, insula, inferior frontal gyrus [IFG], middle temporal gyrus [MTG], and PMA). Conclusions: As predicted, for partner images and for happy facial pho-tos, HSP scores were associated with stronger activation of brain regions involved in awareness, empathy, and self-other processing. These results provide evidence that awareness and responsiveness are fundamental features of SPS, and show how the brain may mediate these traits.},

abstract = {A few previous studies have shown that narcissistic traits in youth are positively associated with bullying. However, research examining the developmental relationship between narcissism and bullying is lacking. Moreover, it is unclear whether narcissists constitute a homogeneous group and whether the bullying of narcissistic youth results in establishing social dominance over peers. The present work addresses these gaps. Children (N = 393; M age = 10.3; 51 {\%} girls) were followed during the last 3 years of primary school. Person-centered analyses were used to examine whether groups with distinct developmental trajectories for narcissism and two bullying forms (direct and indirect) can be identified, and how these trajectories are related. Multiple groups emerged for all constructs examined. For girls, higher narcissism was neither related to more intense bullying, nor to higher social dominance. In contrast, highly narcissistic boys were more likely than their peers to show elevated direct bullying, and in particular elevated indirect bullying. Hence, high narcissism is a risk factor for bullying in boys, but not in girls. However, narcissism is not always accompanied by high bullying, given that many boys on the high bullying trajectories were not high in narcissism. Results show that among narcissistic youth only those who engage in high levels of bullying are high in social dominance.},

In the current studywe examined individual differences in conditioned responses as a function of cardiac activity. In addition to classifying participants as decelerators and accelerators, we examined baseline fear responding and conditioned responses in participants with low and high resting state heart rate variability. We complemented well-established physiologicalmeasures (startle response and skin conductance) and online distress and retrospective expectancy ratings of fear conditioning with measures of heart rate (HR). In contrast to accelerators, decelerators did not show any sign of startle fear conditioning, but demonstrated increased differential conditioning of online distress. Only marginal differences in contextual anxiety and conditioned fear responding were observed for low and high HRV individuals. These results may contribute to the identification of individuals who are at risk for the development of anxiety disorders.},

Their measure of high sensitivity, the Highly Sensitive Person Scale (HSPS), predicts negative life-outcomes. However, previous research questioned the unidimensional nature of the questionnaire, and proposed its division into two-or three-factor mod-els, with a handful of items reflecting a distinct type of sensitivity. Two studies (N = 154 and N = 118) extended previous findings by showing that this distinct sensitivity subscale had the weakest correla-tions with the full HSP scale and its other subscales, and that it had a distinctive and more desirable pat-tern of associations with personality traits and well-being measures, compared to other sensitivities. Our findings suggest that not all sensory-processing sensitivities are associated with undesirable life-out-comes, and emphasize the value of developing sensitivity measures further.},

abstract = {The authors propose an interpersonal social– cognitive theory of the self and personality, the relational self, in which knowledge about the self is linked with knowledge about significant others, and each linkage embodies a self– other relationship. Mental representations of significant others are activated and used in interpersonal encounters in the social– cognitive phenomenon of transference (S. M. Andersen {\&} N. S. Glassman, 1996), and this evokes the relational self. Variability in relational selves depends on interpersonal contextual cues, whereas stability derives from the chronic accessibility of significant-other representations. Relational selves function in if–then terms (W. Mischel {\&} Y. Shoda, 1995), in which ifs are situations triggering transference, and thens are relational selves. An individual's repertoire of relational selves is a source of interpersonal patterns involving affect, motivation, self-evaluation, and self-regulation. The nature of the self has long perplexed and intrigued scholars across a broad spectrum of academic disciplines. In psychology alone, well over a century of inquiry has translated into a virtual explosion of theory and research in recent decades, especially in social psychology, all aiming to chart the contours of the self. Sharing this aim, we propose an interpersonal social– cognitive theory of the self that draws on theory and research in social cognition, personality psychology, and clinical psychology. Our central argument is that the self is relational— or even entangled— with significant others and that this has implications for self-definition, self-evaluation, self-regulation, and, most broadly, for personality functioning, expressed in relation to others.},

abstract = {Bayesian decision theory (BDT) is a mathematical framework that allows the experimenter to model ideal performance in a wide variety of visuomotor tasks. The experimenter can use BDT to compute benchmarks for ideal performance in such tasks and compare human performance to ideal. Recently, researchers have asked whether BDT can also be treated as a process model of visuomotor processing. It is unclear what sorts of experiments are appropriate to testing such claims and whether such claims are even meaningful. Any such claim presupposes that observers' performance is close to ideal, and typical experimental tests involve comparison of human performance to ideal. We argue that this experimental criterion, while necessary, is weak. We illustrate how to achieve near-optimal performance in combining perceptual cues with a process model bearing little resemblance to BDT. We then propose experimental criteria termed transfer criteria that constitute more powerful tests of BDT as a model of perception and action. We describe how recent work in motor control can be viewed as tests of transfer properties of BDT. The transfer properties discussed here comprise the beginning of an operationalization (Bridgman, 1927) of what it means to claim that perception is or is not Bayesian inference (Knill {\&} Richards, 1996). They are particularly relevant to research concerning natural scenes since they assess the ability of the organism to rapidly adapt to novel tasks in familiar environments or carry out familiar tasks in novel environments without learning.},

While this may have been considered a remote objective when Neuron was launched in 1988, neuroscience has now evolved to a stage where it is possible to decipher neural-circuit mechanisms in the deepest parts of the cortex, far away from sensory receptors and motoneurons. In this review, we show how studies of place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the entorhinal cortex may provide some of the first glimpses into these mechanisms. We shall review the events that led up to the discovery of grid cells and a functional circuit in the entorhinal cortex and highlight what we currently see as the big questions in this field--questions that, if resolved, will add to our understanding of cortical computation in a general sense.},

abstract = {To make efficient use of their limited signaling capacity, sensory systems often use predictive coding. Predictive coding works by exploiting the statistical regularities of the environment—specifically, by filtering the sensory input to remove its predictable elements, thus enabling the neural signal to focus on what cannot be guessed. To do this, the neural filters must remove the environmental correlations. If predic-tive coding is to work well in multiple environments, sensory systems must adapt their filtering properties to fit each environment's statistics. Using the visual system as a model, we determine whether this happens. We compare retinal ganglion cell dynamics in two very different environments: white noise and natural. Because natural environments have more power than that of white noise at low temporal frequencies, predictive coding is expected to produce a sup-pression of low frequencies and an enhancement of high frequencies, compared with the behavior in a white-noise environment. We find that this holds, but only in part. First, predictive coding behavior is not uniform: most ON cells manifest it, whereas OFF cells, on average, do not. Overlaid on this nonuniformity between cell classes is further nonunifor-mity within both cell classes. These findings indicate that functional considerations beyond predictive coding play an important role in shap-ing the dynamics of sensory adaptation. Moreover, the differences in behavior between ON and OFF cell classes add to the growing evidence that these classes are not merely homogeneous mirror images of each other and suggest that their roles in visual processing are more complex than expected from the classic view.},

abstract = {Introduction: The aim of this study was to systematically review the impact of guidance on the efficacy of Internet-based interventions. Methods: Included were RCTs with a comparison of (1) guided vs. unguided interventions, (2) different doses of guidance, (3) different qualification levels of e-coaches, and (4) synchronous vs. asynchronous communication mode. Outcomes were symptom severity, completer rates and number of completed intervention modules. A systematic search of MEDLINE, CENTRAL and PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and Psyndex (search date 4th June 2013) was conducted, as well as a hand search of trial-registers and the reference lists of included articles. Methodological quality was rated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Relevant study characteristics and outcome data were extracted. Random-effects analyses were conducted if appropriate. Results: 5328 articles were retrieved of which 14 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Guided interventions were significantly superior to unguided interventions ((symptom severity: standardized mean difference (. SMD). =. -. .27 [. 95{\%} CI: -. .45; -. .10]), n. =. 8; completed modules: SMD=. .52 [.37; .67], n. =. 7; completer rate: OR=. 2.76 [1.68; 4.53], n. =. 6). The four trials that examined different levels of e-coach qualification showed no significant differences on either of the outcome measures. Only one trial each examined the remaining two research questions, without significant effects on either of the outcome measures. Conclusions: Guidance is a beneficial feature of Internet-based interventions, although its effect is smaller than reported before when compared to unguided interventions. The qualification of the e-coaches seems of minor importance. However, methodological limitations need to be considered when interpreting these findings. Overall, the number of studies was small and mainly limited to depression and social phobia restricting the generalizability of the findings.},

abstract = {Learning to optimally predict rewards requires agents to account for fluctuations in reward value. Recent work suggests that individuals can efficiently learn about variable rewards through adaptation of the learning rate, and coding of prediction errors relative to reward variability. Such adaptive coding has been linked to midbrain dopamine neurons in nonhuman primates, and evidence in support for a similar role of the dopaminergic system in humans is emerging from fMRI data. Here, we sought to investigate the effect of dopaminergic perturbations on adaptive prediction error coding in humans, using a between-subject, placebo-controlled pharmacological fMRI study with a dopaminergic agonist (bromocriptine) and antagonist (sulpiride). Participants performed a previously validated task in which they predicted the magnitude of upcoming rewards drawn from distributions with varying SDs. After each prediction, participants received a reward, yielding trial-by-trial prediction errors. Under placebo, we replicated previous observations of adaptive coding in the midbrain and ventral striatum. Treatment with sulpiride attenuated adaptive coding in both midbrain and ventral striatum, and was associated with a decrease in performance, whereas bromocriptine did not have a significant impact. Although we observed no differential effect of SD on performance between the groups, com-putational modeling suggested decreased behavioral adaptation in the sulpiride group. These results suggest that normal dopaminergic func-tion is critical for adaptive prediction error coding, a key property of the brain thought to facilitate efficient learning in variable environments. Crucially, these results also offer potential insights for understanding the impact of disrupted dopamine function in mental illness.},

In Study 1, a nationally representative sample of persons aged 54 and older completed a telephone interview as part of a study of health and aging. Higher levels of loneliness were associated with more depressive symptoms, net of the effects of age, gender, ethnicity, education, income, marital status, social support, and perceived stress. In Study 2, detailed measures of loneliness, social support, perceived stress, hostility, and demographic characteristics were collected over a 3-year period from a population-based sample of adults ages 50-67 years from Cook County, Illinois. Loneliness was again associated with more depressive symptoms, net of demographic covariates, marital status, social support, hostility, and perceived stress. Latent variable growth models revealed reciprocal influences over time between loneliness and depressive symptomatology. These data suggest that loneliness and depressive symptomatology can act in a synergistic effect to diminish well-being in middle-aged and older adults.

abstract = {It is widely appreciated that our understanding of nonequilibrium phenomena has not kept pace with its equilibrium counterpart. In recent years, however, consideration of the above question, posed at the microscopic level of statistical mechanics, has yielded some intriguing theoretical results distinguished by two common features. First, the results remain valid far from equilibrium, that is, even if the system is disturbed violently from its initial equilibrium state. Second, they incorporate information about the history of the system over some span of time; effectively, these results are statistical predictions about what we would see if we could watch a movie of the system filmed at the atomic level, rather than predictions about individual snapshots.},

To investigate the psychometric properties of the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) as an outcome measure for the Improving Access to Psychological Therapy programme, assessing its value as an addition to the Patient Health (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder questionnaires (GAD-7). Little research has investigated these properties to date. Methods. Reliability and responsiveness to change were assessed using data from 4,835 patients. Principal components analysis was used to determine whether the WSAS measures a factor distinct from the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Results. The WSAS measures a distinct social functioning factor, has high internal reliability, and is sensitive to treatment effects. Conclusions. The WSAS, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 perform comparably on measures of reliability and sensitivity. The WSAS also measures a distinct social functioning component suggesting it has potential as an additional outcome measure.},

Ten students referred for problem behavior were exposed to a series of assessment trials, which were interspersed among classroom activities throughout the day. Results of these trial-based functional analyses were compared to those of more traditional functional analyses. Outcomes of both assessments showed correspondence in 6 of the 10 cases and partial correspondence in a 7th case. Results of the standard functional analysis suggested reasons for obtained differences in 2 cases of noncorrespondence, which were verified when portions of the trial-based functional analyses were modified and repeated. These results indicate that a trial-based functional analysis may be a viable assessment method when resources needed to conduct a standard functional analysis are unavailable. Implications for classroom-based assessment methodologies and future directions for research are discussed.},

Parti-cipants (N¼ 23, M age (SD) ¼20.2 (1.25), 78{\%} female), with a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score of greater than 10, were randomly assigned to a placebo (corn oil) or LCPUFAs group (1.4 g of eicosa-pentaenoic and docosahexaeonic acids) and were instructed to consume the assigned capsules daily for 21-days. BDI was completed prior to supplementation and at day 21. Group differences in depression status on day 21 were analyzed using chi-square tests. After 21-days of supplementation, there was a significant difference in depression status between groups. 67{\%} of the LCPUFAs no longer met criteria for being depressed, while only 20{\%} in the placebo group were no longer depressed. A mixed ANOVA re-vealed a significant group x time interaction for BDI scores. Post-hoc analyses revealed the LCPFUAs group had a significant reduction in BDI scores over time, while the placebo group's scores did not significantly change. These findings suggest that LCPUFAs may alter depression and depressive symp-tomology in young adults in a relatively short amount of time.},

METHOD Six patients suffering from pure obsession were selected using purposeful sampling method and were included after meeting the inclusion criteria of the study. Patients were assessed using the structured clinical interview for DSM- IV Axis I disorder - patient edition (SCID- I/P). The patients' main obsessions were present including sexual, aggressive and blasphemous thoughts. In response to these obsessions, all patients used covert rituals and compulsive behaviors. In this study, multiple baseline, a major type of single- subject empirical design, was employed. During the baseline (3-7 weeks) and treatment (14 weekly sessions) and follow-up (3 months) patients filled out the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (Revised form) (OCI-R), Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Metacognitive Questionnaire (MCQ), Thought Fusion Inventory (TFI) and Beck Depression Inventory- II (BDI-II). To implement metacognitive therapy, Well's theraputicimstruction for OCD was used. RESULTS The results indicated that Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) is effective in reducing obsessive - compulsive symptoms and in modifying metacognitive beliefs and thought-fusion beliefs. CONCLUSION Metacognitive therapy is effective in treatment of pure obsession.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disentangling the vegetative state from the minimally conscious state is often difficult when relying only on behavioral observation. In this study, we explored a new active evoked-related potentials paradigm as an alternative method for the detection of voluntary brain activity. METHODS: The participants were 22 right-handed patients (10 traumatic) diagnosed as being in a vegetative state (VS) (n = 8) or in a minimally conscious state (MCS) (n = 14). They were presented sequences of names containing the patient's own name or other names, in both passive and active conditions. In the active condition, the patients were instructed to count her or his own name or to count another target name. RESULTS: Like controls, MCS patients presented a larger P3 to the patient's own name, in the passive and in the active conditions. Moreover, the P3 to target stimuli was higher in the active than in the passive condition, suggesting voluntary compliance to task instructions like controls. These responses were even observed in patients with low behavioral responses (e.g., visual fixation and pursuit). In contrast, no P3 differences between passive and active conditions were observed for VS patients. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that active evoked-related potentials paradigms may permit detection of voluntary brain function in patients with severe brain damage who present with a disorder of consciousness, even when the patient may present with very limited to questionably any signs of awareness.},

abstract = {Purpose Anxiety and depressive disorders frequently occur in people with epilepsy (PWE). An information processing model of psychopathology, the Self-Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model specifies that maladaptive metacognitive beliefs and processes play a fundamental role in the development and maintenance of anxiety and depression. This study explored whether metacognitive beliefs would explain additional variance in anxiety and depression after accounting for demographics, physical and/or psychiatric illnesses, epilepsy characteristics and medication issues. The mediational relationships between metacognitive beliefs, worry and anxiety and depression, predicted by the metacognitive model were also explored, Methods Three hundred and forty-nine PWE participated in an online survey and completed self-report questionnaires measuring anxiety, depression, metacognitive beliefs and worry. Participants also provided information on epilepsy characteristics, demographics, comorbid physical and/or psychiatric illnesses, number of, and perceived side effects of, anti-epileptic medication. Results Regression analysis showed that metacognitive beliefs were associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression, and explained additional variance in these outcomes after accounting for the control variables. Furthermore, the fundamental tenet of the metacognitive model was supported; the relationship between negative metacognitive beliefs about uncontrollability and danger of worry and anxious and depressive symptoms was partially mediated by worry. Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate that metacognitive beliefs and processes contribute to anxiety and depression beyond variables often associated with emotional distress in PWE. Further research is required to test if modification of metacognitive beliefs and processes using metacognitive therapy would effectively alleviate anxiety and depression in PWE.},

Based on 117 independent samples over 113 primary studies, the current meta-analytic study showed that transformational leadership was positively related to individual-level follower performance across criterion types, with a stronger relationship for contextual performance than for task performance across most study settings. In addition, transformational leadership was positively related to performance at the team and organization levels. Moreover, both meta-analytic regression and relative importance analyses consistently showed that transformational leadership had an augmentation effect over transactional leadership (contingent reward) in predicting individual-level contextual performance and team-level performance. Contrary to our expectation, however, no augmentation effect of transformational leadership over contingent reward was found in predicting individual-level task performance. Instead, contingent reward explained incremental variance in individual-level task performance beyond that explained by transformational leadership.},

Although we have previously reported that miR124a and its target the brain-derived neutrophic factor (BDNF) play an important role in autism-like behaviors, the molecular and behavioral dysfunctions remain unknown. The aim of this study was to understand the effects of sustained decreases in miR124a and increases of BDNF in the den-tate gyrus (DG) on neonatal isolation-induced anxiety-and autism like behaviors in rats. Here we report that lentiviral-mediated silencing of miR124a in the adult DG attenuated neonatal isolation-induced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and open-field (OF) tests. Also, miR124a silencing decreased autism-like phenotype in the marble burying test (MBT), self-grooming (SG), and social inter-action tests. Pearson's correlations demonstrated that high levels of BDNF, a direct target of miR124a, were negatively correlated with miR124a expression. Interestingly, viral-mediated BDNF overexpression in the DG also reversed the neonatal isolation-induced anxiety-and autism like phenotypes. Collectively, these findings suggest that miR124a, through its target BDNF, may influence neonatal isolation-induced anxiety-and autism like behaviors. In conclusion, these results do support the hypothesis that miR124a in discrete hippocampal areas contributes to anxiety-and autism-like behaviors and may be involved in the neuroadaptations underlying the development of autism spectrum disorders as a persistent and lasting condition, and therefore provide a clearer mechanistic framework for understanding the physiopathology of such psychiatric illnesses.},

Nevertheless, process evaluation is still in its infancy and primarily consists of checklists inspired by the public health intervention literature. In these frameworks, employees are seen as passive recipients whose reactions to pre-developed interventions should be evaluated. Current organizational intervention design rests on a participatory approach and recent process evaluations reveal that employees and line managers influence the implementation and the outcomes of organizational interventions. Following the current foci of current frameworks we may miss out on important information on the influence of both the participatory process and the line managers on intervention outcomes.

Women with BPD, PTSD, and recent and/or imminent serious intentional self-injury (n=13) received one year of DBT with the DBT PE Protocol, plus three months of follow up assessment. The treatment was associated with significant reductions in PTSD, with the majority of patients no longer meeting criteria for PTSD at post-treatment (71.4{\%} of DBT PE Protocol completers, 60.0{\%} of the intent-to-treat sample). A minority of patients (27.3{\%}) engaged in intentional self-injury during the study. Improvements were also found for suicidal ideation, dissociation, trauma-related guilt cognitions, shame, anxiety, depression, and social adjustment. There was no evidence that the DBT PE Protocol led to exacerbations of intentional self-injury urges or behaviors, PTSD, treatment dropout, or crisis service use. Overall, the results indicate that this integrated BPD and PTSD treatment is feasible to implement within one year of treatment, highly acceptable to patients and therapists, safe to administer, and shows promise as an effective intervention for PTSD in this complex and high-risk patient population.},

It is a philosophical study in an Aristotelian perspective, with special emphasis on the anthropological–cultural dimension. It is difficult for such an inquiry to be car- ried out from within psychiatry or clinical psychology, committed as these fields are to their own logic and practical conditions. The issues are, in any case, more ontological than strictly clinical in nature. We there- fore turn to Aristotle, and specifically his doctrine of the four “causes,” to flesh out the social and cultural dimensions of mental disorders. In accordance with the present analysis, the material cause of disorders would be found in the contingencies of life; the formal cause would pertain primarily to the way clinical conditions themselves can serve as models of ‘being ill' in our society; the efficient cause would correspond to the pa- tients themselves, understood as active (albeit less than fully conscious) agents as well as to the pharmaceutical industry and the mass media; the final cause would be found in different adaptive functions served by the dis- order. We conclude that the “mode of being” of most (if not all) mental disorders—in particular, their status as mental disorders—can often have more to do with cultural forms than with biological factors.},

There are many reasons why people work in teams, including managerial beliefs that teamwork can be beneficial to organizational effectiveness. We start this chapter by describing positive outcomes of teamwork for the individual, the team and the organization. In a second step, we define teams and distinguish them from other groupings. Teams are not always effective. How can the effects of teamwork be explained and thus be enhanced? In the following sections, we first outline a model of effective teamwork and then go deeper into aspects and processes that research has shown to be important for team effectiveness. We finish with an overview of the main findings and discuss how contextual and situational aspects can influence team processes, and how factors on individual, team and organizational levels interact.},

Belinda, a Year 12 student had come to see me. She told me that she was struggling with her personal marijuana usage — she was smoking it before school most days and after school every day. She had been seeing the visiting Ted Noff's Drug and Alcohol counsellor regularly, and was able to reel off to me all the reasons why she should stop smoking it — but she hadn't. She sat back, apparently waiting for me to give her some more reasons why she should stop. Instead, I suggested to her that one of the things that affected our behaviour was the kind of things our mind says to us — the thoughts we have about ourselves. I shared with her that my mind sometimes beats me up, and says some pretty harsh things about me, and I wondered if she had the same experience. Oh yes, she said, she had horrible thoughts about herself. I asked would it be okay for her to tell me some of the mean things her mind sometimes said? She started listing a few — dumb, boring . . . Then she said 'Fat'. I noticed her face changed as she admitted to this one. And what does her mind say about that? What does that mean? Her eyes filled with tears. 'It means I'm ugly,' she said. 'And what does your mind say that means?' I asked. 'That no one will ever love me,' she said. And she burst into tears. When she had recovered, we went on to explore her thoughts some more, and found that she frequently compared herself to her friends, and judged that she came up short, especially as far as looks went. In fact, the only time she didn't think about it, the only time she felt all right about herself, was . . . when she was smoking pot.},

abstract = {A field experiment was conducted to study the effect of foliar application of water soluble fertilizer on growth and yield of Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Mill sp.] during kharif 2012 at Zonal Agricultural Research Station, UAS, GKVK, Bengaluru. The experiment was conducted on sandy loam soil which was low in available nitrogen and medium in available phosphorus and potassium. The experiment consisted of five concentrations of water soluble fertilizer (WSF), i.e. no foliar spray (control), 0.25{\%} WSF, 0.5{\%} WSF, 0.75{\%} WSF and 1.0{\%} WSF and three stages of foliar application of WSF (peak flowering stage, pod development stage and both at peak flowering and pod development stages). Significantly higher grain yield (1661 kg ha1) was recorded with foliar application of 1.0{\%} WSF followed by 0.75{\%} WSF (1518 kg ha1) and 0.50{\%} WSF (1454 kg ha-1) and lower yield was obtained with control (1368 kg ha -1). Application of 1.0{\%} WSF increased the grain yield to the extent of 17.66{\%} compared to no foliar spray (control). But there was no significant difference between stages of spray and the interaction between concentration of water soluble fertilizer and stages. The higher yield with 1.0{\%} WSF was due to increased yield attributes such as number of pods per plant (121.8), pod weight per plant (105.5 g) and grain yield per plant (19.9 g). Economic analysis revealed that, foliar application of 1.0{\%} WSF at peak flowering stage was found to be superior. Foliar application of 1.0{\%} WSF at both peak flowering and pod development stages recorded higher gross returns (Rs. 68,049 ha-1) and net returns (Rs.46,299 ha-1). But higher benefit cost ratio (3.28) was recorded with foliar application of 1.0{\%} WSF at peak flowering stage. Foliar application of nutrients has shown significant effect on nutrient uptake by the crop. Foliar spray of 1.0{\%} WSF increased the nutrient uptake of N, P and K followed by 0.75{\%} WSF. Lower uptake of nutrients was recorded with control.},

By enabling symbolic culture, language allows humans to draw on and expand on the knowledge of their ancestors and peers. A common assumption among linguists and psychologists is that although language is critical to our ability to share our thoughts, it plays a minor, if any, role in generating, controlling, and structuring them. I examine some assumptions that led to this view of language and discuss an alternative according to which normal human cognition is language-augmented cognition. I focus on one of the fundamental design features of language—the use of words as symbolic cues—and argue that language acts as a high-level control system for the mind, allowing individuals to sculpt mental representations of others as well as their own.},

abstract = {In previous experiments on contextual memory, we proposed that the unreinforced re-exposure to the learning context (conditioned stimulus, CS) acts as a switch guiding the memory course toward reconsolidation or extinction, depending on reminder duration. This proposal implies that the system computes the total exposure time to the context, from CS onset to CS offset, and therefore, that the reminder presentation must be terminated for the switching mechanism to become operative. Here we investigated to what extent this requirement is necessary, and we explored the relation between diverse phases in the reconsolidation and extinction processes. We used the contextual memory model of the crab Chasmagnathus which involves an association between the learning context (CS) and a visual danger stimulus (unconditioned stimulus, US). Administration of cycloheximide was used to test the lability state of memory at different time points. The results show that two factors, no-reinforcement during the reminder (i.e., CS re-exposure) and CS offset are the necessary conditions for both processes to occur. Regardless of the reminder duration, memory retrieved by unreinforced CS re-exposure emerges intact and consolidated when tested before CS offset, suggesting that neither reconsolidation nor extinction is concomitant with CS re-exposure. Either process could only be triggered once the definitive mismatch between CS and US is confirmed by CS termination without the expected reinforcement.},

Although there are different views of work engagement, most scholars agree that engaged employees have high levels of energy and identify strongly with their work. The most often used instrument to measure engagement is the UtrechtWork Engagement Scale, a self-report instrument that has been validated in many countries across the world. Research on engagement has investigated how engagement differs from related concepts (e.g., workaholism, organizational commitment), and has focused on the most important predictors of work engagement. These studies have revealed that engagement is a unique concept that is best predicted by job resources (e.g., autonomy, supervisory coaching, performance feedback) and personal resources (e.g., optimism, self-efficacy, self-esteem). Moreover, the first studies have shown that work engagement is predictive of job performance and client satisfaction. The paper closes with an account of what we do not know about work engagement, and offers a brief research agenda for future work.},

The complex molecules of our cells can rightfully be called "molecular machines," or "nanobots"; these machines, unlike any other, work autonomously to create order out of chaos. Tiny electrical motors turn electrical voltage into motion, tiny factories custom-build other molecular machines, and mechanical machines twist, untwist, separate and package strands of DNA.

Caregivers of 235 children (3–16 years) completed the HSPS as well as questions on daily functioning. First, the factor structure of the HSPS was explored and evaluated. Second, both differences in reported problems between a high SPS and a control group, and in SPS factors between children with few versus many problems, were examined. Re-sults suggested that the scores of the HSPS have good internal consistency and supported a two-factor structure which distinguishes Overreaction to Stimuli (OS) and Depth of Processing (DP). Children with high SPS were re-ported to have more internalizing problems. High OS was more common in children who cried excessively as a baby, children with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS), sleeping, eating and drinking problems while high DP was more common in children with MUPS and sleeping problems. This study provides the first em-pirical evidence that the parent-report HSPS may add valuable information to the assessment of children with problems in daily functioning.},

However, some of this interest seems to have been based on some false assumptions that (1) attachment measures can be used as definitive assessments of the individual in forensic/child protection settings and that disorganized attachment (2) reliably indicates child maltreatment, (3) is a strong predictor of pathology, and (4) represents a fixed or static “trait” of the child, impervious to development or help. This paper summarizes the evidence showing that these four assumptions are false and misleading. The paper reviews what is known about disorganized infant attachment and clarifies the implications of the classification for clinical and welfare practice with children. In particular, the difference between disorganized attachment and attachment disorder is examined, and a strong case is made for the value of attachment theory for supportive work with families...},

abstract = {The aim of the current study was to examine the direct and interactive effects of two types of narcissism (overt and covert) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) reactivity on emotion regulation difficulties in 227 undergraduate students. Overt and covert narcissism and emotion regulation difficulties were assessed with self-report measures (narcissistic personality inventory (NPI)-16, hypersensitive narcissism scale (HSNS), and difficulties in emotion regulation scale (DERS)), and physiological data were measured during the baseline, stress (a public-speaking task), and recovery periods in the laboratory. Results indicated that overt narcissism was negatively related to a lack of emotional awareness and emotional clarity, whereas covert narcissism was positively related to overall emotion regulation difficulties, nonacceptance of emotional responses, impulse control difficulties, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and a lack of emotional clarity. RSA reactivity in response to a mock job interview moderated the associations between covert narcissism (as a predictor) and overall emotion regulation difficulties and impulse control difficulties (as outcomes). This finding showed that a greater stress-induced RSA decrease may serve as a protective factor and ameliorate the effect of covert narcissism on individuals' emotion regulation difficulties.},

abstract = {One major contribution of neuroscience to understanding cognitive development has been in demonstrating that biology is not destiny-that is, demonstrating the remarkable role of experience in shaping the mind, brain, and body. Only rarely has neuroscience provided wholly new insights into cognitive development, but often it has provided evidence of mechanisms by which observations of developmental psychologists could be explained. Behavioral findings have often remained controversial until an underlying biological mechanism for them was offered. Neuroscience has demonstrated promise for detecting cognitive problems before they are behaviorally observable-and, hence, promise for early intervention. In this article, we discuss examples drawn from imitation and mirror neurons, phenylketonuria (PKU) and prefrontal dopamine, maternal touch and stress reactivity, and non-genetic (behavioral) intergenerational transmission of biological characteristics.},

In study 1, factor analyses using a student sample revealed 13 primary schemas. A hierarchical factor analysis revealed three higher-order factors. In study 2, factor anaOrses using a patient sample revealed 15 primary schemas. The patient and student samples produced similar sets of primaq factors which also closely matched the rationally developed schemas and their hypothesized hierarchical relationships (Youn{\~{}} 1991). The primary subscales were found to possess adequate test-retest reliability and internal consistency. In study 3, the SQ was found to possess convergent and discriminant validity with respect to measures of psychological distress, self-esteem, cognitive vulnerab'dity for depression, and personality disorder symptoms.},

abstract = {The Internet is the latest in a series of technological breakthroughs in interpersonal communication, following the telegraph, telephone, radio, and television. It combines innovative features of its predecessors, such as bridging great distances and reaching a mass audience. However, the Internet has novel features as well, most critically the relative anonymity afforded to users and the provision of group venues in which to meet others with similar interests and values. We place the Internet in its historical context, and then examine the effects of Internet use on the user's psychological well-being, the formation and maintenance of personal relationships, group memberships and social identity, the workplace, and community involvement. The evidence suggests that while these effects are largely dependent on the particular goals that users bring to the interaction-such as self-expression, affiliation, or competition-they also interact in important ways with the unique qualities of the Internet communication situation.},

An analogous length variation of the 5-HTTLPR has been reported in rhesus monkeys (rh5-HTTLPR). A retrospective association study was conducted on 115 rhe-sus macaque infants either homozygous for the long 5HTTLPR variant (l/l) or heterozygous for the short and long form (l/s). To assess contributions of genotype and early rearing environment, 36 mother-reared monkeys (l/l = 26, l/s = 10) and 79 nursery-reared monkeys (l/l = 54, l/s = 25) were assessed on days 7, 14, 21, and 30 of life on a standardized primate neurobehavioral test designed to measure orienting, motor maturity, reflex functioning, and temperament. Both mother-reared and nursery-reared heterozygote animals demonstrated increased affective responding relative to l/l homozygotes. Nursery-reared, but not mother-reared, l/s infants exhibited lower orientation scores than their l/l counterparts. These results demonstrate the contributions of rearing environment and genetic background, and their inter-action, in a nonhuman primate model of behavioral development.

Its psychometric properties, validity and sensitivity to change have been supported in several studies. However, no explicit psychometric or validity study of WSAS has been performed on data from a large sample of psychiatric outpatients, with and without personality disorders. The aim of this study was therefore to provide additional knowledge of the properties of WSAS in such a sample. The material comprised data from 1371 patients, from 15 different units participating in the Norwegian Network of Personality-Focused Treatment Programs. Psychometric properties of the scale, such as measurement invariance among males and females, longitudinal invariance, as well as associations with other clinical measures and sensitivity to change were analysed. The results confirm that WSAS constitutes a reliable, unidimensional and gender invariant measure, sensitive to change and to severity of mental distress. Although highly associated with levels of depression, WSAS measures a clinically important aspect of impairment.},

The overall weighted effect size (Cohen's d) for all studies was 0.526 (95{\%} confidence interval = 0.364, 0.687), a significant medium to large effect. Interventions were coded as cognitive-behavioral, relaxation, organizational, multimodal, or alternative. Analyses based on these subgroups suggested that intervention type played a moderating role. Cognitive-behavioral programs consistently produced larger effects than other types of interventions, but if additional treatment components were added the effect was reduced. Within the sample of studies, relaxation interventions were most frequently used, and organizational interventions continued to be scarce. Effects were based mainly on psychological outcome variables, as opposed to physiological or organizational measures. The examination of additional moderators such as treatment length, outcome variable, and occupation did not reveal significant variations in effect size by intervention type.},

abstract = {The appearance of alpha–theta neurofeedback coincides with a major shift in the course of psychotherapy, one which appears to be leading us toward a much broader and more complex paradigm that might be described as neurobehavioral therapy. Neurobehavioral therapy approaches brain, mind, emotion, feeling and their behavioral expressions as a multilevel matrix. This chapter aims to introduce and describe the alpha–theta protocol, explain how and why it works to the extent current research supports such explanations, and discuss some implications for its use in clinical practice. The central thesis of the chapter is that alpha–theta neurotherapy, specifically the Peniston protocol of alpha–theta neurofeedback therapy and its modifications, provides a powerful therapeutic medium by which neurobehavioral healing can and does take place. In that connection, the chapter proposes to show that there is significant support for the effectiveness of this healing process, as well as provide some insight into the mechanisms by which it may work, in the literature of neuroscience, neurotherapy and related fields. The chapter has four distinct parts. First, it reprises the original research of Peniston and Kulkosky, and define the nature and function of the protocol itself. Next, it offers some explanations as to its broad range of effectiveness, both literature-based and theoretical. Then it discusses some of the ways in which the protocol opens a multilevel matrix of healing, effective on a wide range of seemingly disparate diagnoses. Finally, it describes how alpha–theta neurofeedback may be used effectively in a multi-modality approach to treating addictions, mood disorders and emotional trauma.},

abstract = {Notions of citizenship and civic identity are central to political theory and political psychology. We explore the various meanings of civic identity, and suggest that the concept is best understood as having subjective, ethical, and political facets. The prominence of civic identity in constructions of citizenship is then considered. We use civic identity embedded in the context of citizenship to refract contemporary debates concerning globalization and immigration. Our review suggests that civic identity figures prominently in each debate, with proponents of different perspectives in these debates varying in their views about the kinds of civic identities morally desirable and politically necessary. In the final section, data from a large international survey of adolescents are used to explore the relations of different facets of civic identity and citizenship. We conclude with suggestions for future research and conceptual exploration.},

abstract = {The MacArthur model of successful aging encompasses three principal components: low risk of disease and disease-related disability; maintenance of high mental and physical function; and continued engagement with life, which includes relations with others and productive activ-ity, either paid or volunteered. In the 27 years since we first articulated the core principles of the model, it has received sustained attention in gerontological theory, empirical research, and practice (Rowe {\&} Kahn, 1987, 1997, 1998). Thousands of articles have been written on the concept and its components, and more than 100 variations of the original model have been proposed. Some of these varia-tions call for a greater emphasis on social factors that may influence the capacity for successful aging (Riley, 1999); others propose a more subjective definition of the concept itself and greater attention to individuals' perceptions of their own aging and the effects of earlier life experiences. The importance of antecedent events as determinants of successful aging is emphasized in the suggestion that the model incorporate a life-course perspective. The model's far reach and impact also is reflected in the establishment of successful aging centers at several universities, including Rowan University in New Jersey, the University of Toledo in Ohio, and California State University in Fullerton. The model is not without its critics, however. In fact, the number and variety of critiques has become so large that Martinson and Berridge (2015, 4), in a special issue of The Gerontologist dedicated to the concept of successful aging, divided them into four distinct categories. The miss-ing voices critique, which accounted for 45{\%} of published critiques, calls for greater consideration of subjective com-ponents of successful aging; add and stir (25{\%}) calls for other expansions to the model; hard hitting (20{\%}), demands a more inclusive definition of successful aging and avoid-ance of " stigma and discrimination " of those not aging well; and new frames and names (10{\%}), which attempts to correct or replace a perceived Western cultural bias in the MacArthur model. Masoro's (2001) early condemnation of the MacArthur model as misleading and deserving of abandonment is a minority view. Rachel Pruchno, editor-in -chief of the Gerontologist, calls for developing consensus about what successful aging is and how it should be measured by build-ing on current empirical and theoretical work. (Pruchno, 2015). In the same issue Stowe and Cooney (2015) con-clude that " the popularity of the model in the mainstream literature and its extensive use in scientific inquiry warrants modification over disposal. " We embrace this continued and intense dialogue, and hope it leads to strengthening the model and informing future empirical research. A recent suggestion for pursuing both of these goals was proposed by Silverstein (2015), who noted that social and behavioral scientists should recognize more fully the poten-tial value of information on biomarkers and genetics as pre-dictors of successful aging. This view is in sharp contrast with the concerns of some early critics, who felt that the model was too biomedical. In fact, the MacArthur Research Network on Successful Aging was, from its inception, an interdisciplinary group. In 1984, the foundation officers assembled a group of 16 scholars from various disciplines relevant to aging and invited us to develop the conceptual basis for a " new gerontology. " Our assignment was to " gather the knowledge needed to improve older Americans' physi-cal and mental health. " In a field that was then dominated by measures of central tendency and neglect of variability, our network was immediately interested in the distinction between " usual " and " better than usual " aging. And at some point in the group discussions, " better than usual " became " successful. " Both the concept and the model of successful aging were the product of our sustained interdisciplinary collaboration and conversations. We recognize, however, that important discipline-based theories of well-being have developed both alongside and following the development of the successful aging model. For example, Paul Baltes's selection-optimization-compen-sation (SOC) model (Baltes {\&} Smith, 2003) is psychology-based, as is Carstensen's (1992) socioemotional selectivity theory. These important psychologically based models, both of which are life-course oriented, emphasize the " how " of successful aging whereas the MacArthur model empha-sized the " what. " As many observers have pointed out, the important influ-ence of social factors on the capacity of individuals to age successfully was not explicit in the initial formulation of the MacArthur model. These factors include personal charac-teristics such as race, gender, sexual orientation, and socio-economic status. They also encompass characteristics of the individual's immediate interpersonal environment, such as family structure and friendships. And there are more distant but powerful macrosocial influences such as economic con-ditions, access to high-quality affordable health care, public transportation, and urban design.},

abstract = {Background Metacognitive therapy (MCT) continues to gain increased ground as a treatment for psychological complaints. During the last years, several clinical trials on the efficacy of MCT have been published. The aim of the current study was to provide an updated meta-analytic review of the effect of MCT for psychological complaints. Methods We conducted a systematic search of trials on MCT for young and adult patients with psychological complaints published until January 2018, using PsycINFO, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Trials with a minimum of 10 participants in the MCT condition were included. Results A total of 25 studies that examined a variety of psychological complaints met our inclusion criteria, of which 15 were randomized controlled trials. We identified only one trial that was conducted with children and adolescents. In trials with adult patients, large uncontrolled effect size estimates from pre- to posttreatment and follow-up suggest that MCT is effective at reducing symptoms of the targeted primary complaint, anxiety, depression, and dysfunctional metacognitions. The comparison with waitlist control conditions also resulted in a large effect (Hedges' g = 2.06). The comparison of MCT to cognitive and behavioral interventions at posttreatment and at follow-up showed pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g) of 0.69 and 0.37 at posttreatment (k = 8) and follow-up (k = 7), respectively. Conclusions Our findings indicate that MCT is an effective treatment for a range of psychological complaints. To date, strongest evidence exists for anxiety and depression. Current results suggest that MCT may be superior to other psychotherapies, including cognitive behavioral interventions. However, more trials with larger number of participants are needed in order to draw firm conclusions.},

The present study examined the early positive and negative emotional reactions to clients of four therapists, together with observed client in-session resistance, and changes in resistance from early to midtreatment, in a sample of 30 outpatients receiving eight sessions (14 hr) of CBT for generalized anxiety disorder. Findings indicated that greater therapist early positive reactions to clients, especially liking, enjoyment, and attachment, were associated with significantly lower levels of client resistance midtreatment and greater reductions in client resistance from early to midtreatment. These effects were independent of therapist competence in delivering CBT, suggesting a potentially unique and important role for therapist feelings about clients beyond the skillful delivery of treatment techniques. Greater early negative therapist reactions to clients were less consistently related to client resistance but power struggles, and feeling drained, helpless, guilty, and frustrated were associated with higher levels of client subsequent resistance.},

One hundred thirty-two anxious or depressed outpatients were randomly assigned to receive either CT or ACT, and were assessed at posttreatment (n=90) and at 1.5-year (n=91) follow-up. As previously reported, the two treatments were equivalently effective at posttreatment according to measures of depression, anxiety, overall (social/occupational/symptom-related) functioning, and quality of life. However, current results suggest that treatment gains were better maintained at follow-up in the CT condition. Clinical significance analyses revealed that, at follow-up, one-third more CT patients were in the clinically normative range in terms of depressive symptoms and more than twice as many CT patients were in the normative range in terms of functioning levels.

@article{Fenn2003,
abstract = {We have demonstrated consolidation during sleep for complex, generalized skill acquisition. Previous research has shown that sleep affects perceptual 4,7,8 and motor learning 10 , in tasks limited to specific patterns or spatial locations. In the present study, participants learned a new mapping from complex acoustical patterns to preexisting linguistic categories, which generalized to new stimuli 14,15 . This behaviour involves distinct processes 17 , the formation of specific memories associated with the learned words (episodic, declarative representations), and the establishment of a mapping defined over the set of learned words that supports generalization to new utterances (procedural learning). When participants are given equal amounts of training across days with a small set of repeated words or with entirely novel words, different patterns of learning are seen. Training on a set of repeated words produces nearperfect performance on those words, but very poor generalization to novel test items. Training on all novel items produces a much larger generalization effect on the posttest 15 . The generalization effect cannot be accounted for by memorizing acoustic patterns of phonemes, because different acoustic patterns may represent the same phoneme and the same pattern may represent different phonemes 18 , depending on context. These contextconditioned effects even span syllable boundaries 19 and are used in perception 20 . The acoustic patterns of phonemes in different phonetic contexts cannot be statistically inferred from the distribution of a sample of those utterances 21 , and rote memorization and linear interpolation across a small set of acoustic patterns for each consonant and vowel cannot explain human speech recognition 22 . To recognize new words, listeners must learn to generalize, predicting the acoustic consequences of different phonetic contexts. Sleep has at least two separate effects on learning. Sleep consolidates memories, protecting them against subsequent interference or decay. Sleep also appears to 'recover' or restore memories. In the perceptual learning task we used, memories are sufficiently robust to last for up to six months 14 or, in a comparable readingacquisition task, even a year 23 . Such robust memory represents a significant selective advantage that an organism might accrue from sleepmediated processes. Learning can take place at any time during a waking period and any loss due to decay or interference will be restored by sleep. This also implies that a selective advantage of sleep is to enable organisms to learn opportunistically any time during the day without penalty as to robustness of learning. We do not know if the reduction in performance observed after periods of wakefulness is due to decay of learned material, or to interference from listening to speech or other cognitive processing during the day. If performance is reduced by interference, sleep might strengthen relevant associations and/or weaken irrelevant associations, improving access to relevant memories. If performance is reduced by decay, sleep might actively recover what has been lost, presumably by an interaction between partially retained memories (words) and partially retained mappings that resulted from learning the word set. A Methods Participants listened to computergenerated monosyllabic consonant–vowel–consonant (CVC) words taken from a phonetically balanced (PB) list (approximating the distribution of phonemes in English) 24 , and responded by typing the word. During training, a series of synthetic speech words were presented over headphones paired with the printed form of the word as feedback. After each training block, participants identified the trained words. A pretest and posttest were given before and after training, during which participants identified different sets of words without feedback. The pretest and posttest each consisted of 100 PB words, and the two training sessions each consisted of 150 PB words. The training sessions were structured into three blocks of 50 words. Participants rested between blocks. Word lists for testing and training were counterbalanced across participants. The 84 participants (all groups) were 20.3 {\^{}} 2.3 (mean {\^{}} s.d.) years old; each participated in one group only. Stimuli were delivered through Sennheiser HD 570 headphones with an r.m.s. sound pressure level of 66.5 dB. One group had two posttraining periods of testing. In the second posttest, participants were tested with a further set of 100 PB words that no other group was trained or tested on. The consistency of the result for the second posttest argues against any materials effect and further emphasizes the robustness of the findings.

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback is a method based on paced breathing at specific rate called resonance frequency by giving online feedbacks from user respiration and its effect on HRV. Since the HRV is also influence by different factors like stress and emotions, stress related to an unfamiliar measurement device, cables and skin electrodes may cover the underling effect of such kind of intervention. Wearable systems are usually considered as intuitive solutions which are more familiar to the end-user and can help to improve usability and hence reducing the stress. In this work, a prototype of a knitted garment using intarsia technique is developed and evaluated. Results show the satisfactory level of quality for Electrocardiogram and thoracic electrical bioimpedance i.e. for respiration monitoring as a part of HRV biofeedback system. Using intarsia technique and conductive yarn for making the connection instead of cables will reduce the complexity of fabrication in textile production and hence reduce the final costs in a final commercial product. Further development of garment and Android application is ongoing and usability and efficiency of final prototype will be evaluated in detail.},

abstract = {Aron Gurwitsch's theory of the structure and dynamics of consciousness has much to offer contemporary theorizing about consciousness and its basis in the embodied brain. On Gurwitsch's account, as we develop it, the field of consciousness has a variable sized focus or "theme" of attention surrounded by a structured periphery of inattentional contents. As the field evolves, its contents change their status, sometimes smoothly, sometimes abruptly. Inner thoughts, a sense of one's body, and the physical environment are dominant field contents. These ideas can be linked with (and help unify) contemporary theories about the neural correlates of consciousness, inattention, the small world structure of the brain, meta-stable dynamics, embodied cognition, and predictive coding in the brain.},

abstract = {The following two chapters (9 and 10) by Hughes and Barnes‐Holmes in this part of the CBS handbook provide a very detailed and systematic review of relational frame theory (RFT) and its evidence. As such, there seems little point in recapitulating some of that work in this opening chapter of Part II. Furthermore, the subsequent two chapters provide examples of how RFT has been applied in the domains of educational (chapter 11, Barnes‐Holmes, Kavanagh, {\&} Murphy) and clinical psychology (chapter 12, T{\"{o}}rneke, Luciano, Barnes‐Holmes, {\&} Bond). The current part therefore provides a comprehensive overview of the basic and applied wings of RFT. By way of narrative or commentary, this opening chapter aims to provide a particular perspective, perhaps somewhat controversial at the present time, on the history and future development of the account itself. We begin here by asking the question: What are the historical and intellectual roots of RFT? The seminal volume contains a narrative by Steve Hayes, which addresses the origins of the theory from the personal perspective of the person who first conceptu­ alized the account (Hayes, Barnes‐Holmes, {\&} Roche, 2001). However, we are asking a broader and perhaps more fundamental question here. Why did Steve come up with RFT at that time? Or, in other words, what was the confluence of historical and intel­ lectual variables that led him to do so, and subsequently supported the theory's development and continued growth to this day? Here is our view on the matter.},

abstract = {A theory that purports to explain children's aggressive behavior must begin with an explanation of how it begins. It must also address both the stability in expression of aggression while also explaining the developmental changes in the forms taken by aggression. This chapter focuses on both issues. The general strategy is to think of infant and caregiver exchanges as reflecting complex contributions from the contextual matrix in which these interactions are embedded. Some processes may partially reflect long-standing biological processes (e.g., birth complications, genes), and others represent contextual intrusions, such as divorce, depression, and maternal stress. The key idea is that the impact of these contextual variables on child outcomes is mediated by the nature of the infant and caregiver exchanges. Finally, the antisocial individual carries the dual burden of recognizable deviancy plus obvious social incompetence. Understanding how coercion begins requires that we also study the beginning of social incompetence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

abstract = {This article presents the variations in themes and notions of successful aging that were found in a project that aimed to shed light on the value orientations that people prefer and the understandings of successful aging that they uphold. The project, which aimed also to study the way in which the process of migration challenges the notions in question, shed light on the various types of logic that Iranian immigrants to Sweden use when trying to make sense of the construct of successful aging. This article departs from these variations and discusses, among other things, the inevitable decay with which the aging process seems to be associated; the different purpose-related ideologies that people use when trying to explain how the decay in question ought to be handled; the way in which time-related ideas influence the manner in which notions of aging well are framed; the manner in which divergent views regarding activity shape the understandings of successful aging that people uphold; and the way in which ideas regarding autonomy and dependence shape the way in which one defines a good old age. The complexity of logic types utilized by the informants suggests that, if researchers are to further their understanding of the meaning of the construct of successful aging, they need to dismantle people's ideas as well as the way in which they use culture when trying to make sense of what aging well entails. The article finishes with a brief discussion regarding the importance of intracultural variation and suggests that researchers need a better understanding of culture's impact on the manner in which the construct in question is understood if they are to develop the successful aging paradigm in a culturally informed manner.},

In particular, this article focuses on maximum likelihood estimation and presents two analysis examples from the Longitudinal Study of American Youth data.

Indeed, the penetrability of perceptual processes in a ‘top-down' manner by higher-level cognition—a natural extension of hierarchical models of perception—may contradict a strictly modular view of mental organization. Furthermore, some in the cognitive science community have challenged cognitive penetration as an unlikely, if not impossible, process. We review the evidence for and against top-down influences in perception, informed by a predictive coding model of perception and drawing heavily upon the literature of computational neuroimaging. We extend these findings to propose a way in which these processes may be altered in mental illness. We propose that hallucinations - perceptions without stimulus - can be understood as top-down effects on perception, mediated by inappropriate perceptual priors.},

abstract = {Humans possess great capacity for behavioral and cultural change, but our ability to manage change is still limited. This article has two major objectives: first, to sketch a basic science of intentional change centered on evolution; second, to provide examples of intentional behavioral and cultural change from the applied behavioral sciences, which are largely unknown to the basic sciences community. All species have evolved mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity that enable them to respond adaptively to their environments. Some mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity count as evolutionary processes in their own right. The human capacity for symbolic thought provides an inheritance system having the same kind of combinatorial diversity as does genetic recombination and antibody formation. Taking these propositions seriously allows an integration of major traditions within the basic behavioral sciences, such as behaviorism, social constructivism, social psychology, cognitive psychology, and evolutionary psychology, which are often isolated and even conceptualized as opposed to one another. The applied behavioral sciences include well-validated examples of successfully managing behavioral and cultural change at scales ranging from individuals to small groups to large populations. However, these examples are largely unknown beyond their disciplinary boundaries, for lack of a unifying theoretical framework. Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, they are examples of managing evolved mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity, including open-ended processes of variation and selection. Once the many branches of the basic and applied behavioral sciences become conceptually unified, we are closer to a science of intentional change than one might think.},

@article{Servant2009,
abstract = {Background: The autonomic nervous system sends messages through the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system innervates the cardioaccelerating center of the heart, the lungs (increased ventilatory rhythm and dilatation of the bronchi) and the non-striated muscles (artery contraction). It releases adrenaline and noradrenaline. As opposed to the sympathetic nervous system, it innervates the cardiomoderator center of the heart, the lungs (slower ventilatory rhythm and contraction of the bronchi) and the non-striated muscles (artery dilatation). It uses acetylcholine (ACh) as its neurotransmitter. Sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions function antagonistically to preserve a dynamic modulation of vital functions. These systems act on the heart respectively through the stellar ganglion and the vagus nerve. The interaction of these messages towards the sinoauricular node is responsible for normal cardiac variability, which can be measured by monitoring heart rate variability (HRV). Heart rate is primarily controlled by vagal activity. Sensorial data coming from the heart are fed back to the central nervous system. HRV is an indicator of both how the central nervous system regulates the autonomic nervous system, and of how peripheral neurons feed information back to the central level. HRV measures are derived by estimating the variation among a set of temporally ordered interbeat intervals. The state of perfect symmetry, which, in medical parlance, is called respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), can be described as a state of cardiac coherence. Obtaining a series of interbeat intervals requires a continuous measure of heart rate, typically electrocardiography (ECG). Commercially available software is then used to define the interbeat intervals within an ECG recording. Literature findings: The autonomic nervous system is highly adaptable and allows the organism to maintain its balance when experiencing strain or stress. Conversely, a lack of flexibility and a rigid system can lead to somatic and psychological pathologies. Several studies have shown a link between reduced HRV in postmyocardial infarction patients and increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Recently, studies indicate that patients with depression and anxiety disorders exhibit abnormally low HRV compared with non-psychiatric controls. Reduced HRV seems indicate decreased cardiac vagal tone and elevated sympathetic activity in anxious and depressive patients and would reflect deficit in flexibility of emotional physiological mechanisms. A few studies have also revealed that biofeedback using respiratory control, relaxation and meditation techniques can increase HRV. For now, there is insufficient data to determine if paced respiration or subjective relaxation is necessary or sufficient for the efficacy of HRV biofeedback. Although the literature is modest, this review suggests that the use of biofeedback with relaxation and meditation approaches may result in increased HRV and parasympathetic activity. Limitations of the review literature have also been considered to identify areas for future research. {\textcopyright} 2008 L'Enc{\'{e}}phale, Paris.},

abstract = {Music of varied kinds consistently triggers a large range of drives and emotions, which, in turn, induce a particular class of mental experiences known as feelings. The feelings are often pleasurable, though not necessarily. Neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies, in normal individuals as well as in patients with focal neurological lesions, reveal that music can change the state of large-scale neural systems of the human brain. The changes are not confined to brain sectors related to auditory and motor processing; they also occur in regions related to the regulation of life processes (homeostasis), including those related to emotions and feelings, most prominently in the insula and cingulate cortices, in the ventral striatum, in the amygdala, and in certain upper brainstem nuclei. The ease with which music leads to feelings, the predictability with which it does so, the fact that human beings of many cultures actively seek and consume music, and the evidence that early humans engaged in music practices lead us to hypothesize that music has long had a consistent relation to the neural devices of human life regulation. It is conceivable that, as a result, music-induced feelings can be informative and nourishing at the individual level and can also operate as significant promoters of sociocultural organization. We venture that the close relationship between music and feelings along with music's effectiveness in certain personal and social contexts, that is, its roles in homeostasis, explain, at least in part, the considerable degree of selection and replication of music-related phenomena, both biologically and culturally. As the invention of music forms continued and as intellectual analysis of compositions and reflection on music expanded, the practices and uses of music became less closely aligned with its affective and homeostatic aspects and, to a certain degree, gained autonomy relative to those aspects. This may account for the varied panorama of music invention, practice, and consumption that can be found today. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Prior to 2000, personal practice (PP) for therapists mostly meant personal therapy. Recently a new landscape of PPs has emerged, with meditation-based programs and therapy self-practice/self-reflection (SP/SR) programs playing an increasing role in training and personal/professional development. The challenge now for practitioners and researchers is to refocus on the role of PPs in training and professional development. Are PPs of value - or not? Do they have a role in therapist development? How might PPs enhance therapist skilfulness? Do different PPs act in similar or different ways? Currently, the PP literature lacks a theoretical framework to guide practitioners in their choice of PPs or researchers in their choice of research questions and measures. The purpose of this article is to provide such a framework, the Personal Practice (PP) model. The PP model proposes primary impacts of PPs in four domains: personal development/wellbeing, self-awareness, interpersonal beliefs/attitudes/skills and reflective skills. The model also suggests a secondary impact on therapists' conceptual/technical skills when therapists use reflection to consider the implications of their PP for their "therapist self". We offer some suggestions to enhance the quality of future research, and conclude that PPs may play an important and perhaps unique role in therapist training.; },

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Debriefs (or "after-action reviews") are increasingly used in training and work environments as a means of learning from experience. We sought to unify a fragmented literature and assess the efficacy of debriefs with a quantitative review.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nBACKGROUND: Used by the U.S. Army to improve performance for decades, and increasingly in medical, aviation, and other communities, debriefs systematize reflection, discussion, and goal setting to promote experiential learning. Unfortunately, research and theory on debriefing has been spread across diverse disciplines, so it has been difficult to definitively ascertain debriefing effectiveness and how to enhance its effectiveness.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: We conducted an extensive quantitative meta-analysis across a diverse body of published and unpublished research on team- and individual-level debriefs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Findings from 46 samples (N = 2,136) indicate that on average, debriefs improve effectiveness over a control group by approximately 25{\%} (d = .67). Average effect sizes were similar for teams and individuals, across simulated and real settings, for within- or between-group control designs, and for medical and nonmedical samples. Meta-analytic methods revealed a bolstering effect of alignment and the potential impact of facilitation and structure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Organizations can improve individual and team performance by approximately 20{\%} to 25{\%} by using properly conducted debriefs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAPPLICATION: Debriefs are a relatively inexpensive and quick intervention for enhancing performance. Our results lend support for continued and expanded use of debriefing in training and in situ. To gain maximum results, it is important to ensure alignment between participants, focus and intent, and level of measurement.},

abstract = {Watching and rating psychotherapy sessions is an important yet often overlooked component of psychotherapy training. This article provides a simple and straightforward guide for using one Website (www.ATOStrainer.com) that provides an automated training protocol for rating of psychotherapy sessions. By the end of the article, readers will be able to have the knowledge to go to the Website and begin using this training method as soon as they have a recorded session to view. This article presents, (a) an overview of the Achievement of Therapeutic Objectives Scale (ATOS; McCullough et al., 2003a), a research tool used to rate psychotherapy sessions; (b) a description of APA training tapes, available for purchase from APA Books, that have been rated and scored by ATOS trained clinicians and posted on the Website; (c) step-by-step procedures on how ratings can be done; (d) an introduction to www. ATOStrainer.com where ratings can be entered and compared with expert ratings; and (e) first-hand personal experiences of the authors using this training method and the benefits it affords both trainees and experienced therapists. This psychotherapy training Website has the potential to be a key resource tool for graduate students, researchers, and clinicians. Our long-range goal is to promote the growth of our understanding of psychotherapy and to improve the quality of psychotherapy provided for patients. Receiving feedback on performance is becoming increasingly recognized in many fields. How many times have we read in the sports section of the newspaper a player or coach after a tough game saying, " we had a rough night but we'll go back and watch the film to see where we went wrong, " or when planning for the next opponent, " we're going to watch film on their players to better understand how they implement their strategies. " Watching video plays a crucial role in the development of athlete's skills, assisting both player and coach with learning team strategies, improving team chemistry and identifying specific areas in which the player needs to further improve and develop. The key is that continuous practice and observation improves performance en-abling you to become a better athlete. With repetition and proper technique, a basketball player perfects the art of shooting; a base-ball player improves his hitting stance; a golfer learns the proper technique and form to drive the golf ball properly. These skills are enhanced by the athlete and coach sitting together and analyzing videotapes to decipher ways the athlete performs each task, and how they can improve. Performance video-recordings allows for an objective evaluation of techniques and progress and a platform for the coach to provide individualized feedback for the athlete. Psychotherapy, like art or music, is taught in the master-apprentice model, but historically the apprentice never could see the master practice! Now with the use of recorded sessions, the psychotherapy trainee can see the " masters " at work, and can gauge their own progress in skills based on that. As such, there are now parallels between sports training and learning psychotherapy. Therapists, like athletes, have supervisors as " coaches, " and being able to videotape and rate therapeutic sessions is a valuable com-ponent of supervision and training (McCullough, 2003). Viewing recorded sessions is an objective method to evaluate therapeutic progress and to explore specific areas where the therapist strug-gles. The therapist and supervisor can analyze specific applied},

abstract = {In a group setting, individuals' perceptions of their own level of dominance or of the dominance level of others, and the ability to adequately control their behavior based on these perceptions are crucial for living within a social environment. Recent advances in neural imaging and molecular technology have enabled researchers to investigate the neural substrates that support the perception of social dominance and the formation of a social hierarchy in humans. At the systems' level, recent studies showed that dominance perception is represented in broad brain regions which include the amygdala, hippocampus, striatum, and various cortical networks such as the prefrontal, and parietal cortices. Additionally, neurotransmitter systems such as the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, modulate and are modulated by the formation of the social hierarchy in a group. While these monoamine systems have a wide distribution and multiple functions, it was recently found that the Neuropeptide B/W contributes to the perception of dominance and is present in neurons that have a limited projection primarily to the amygdala. The present review discusses the specific roles of these neural regions and neurotransmitter systems in the perception of dominance and in hierarchy formation.},

abstract = {This paper outlines a hierarchical Bayesian framework for interoception, homeostatic/allostatic control, and meta-cognition that connects fatigue and depression to the experience of chronic dyshomeostasis. Specifically, viewing interoception as the inversion of a generative model of viscerosensory inputs allows for a formal definition of dyshomeostasis (as chronically enhanced surprise about bodily signals, or, equivalently, low evidence for the brain's model of bodily states) and allostasis (as a change in prior beliefs or predictions which define setpoints for homeostatic reflex arcs). Critically, we propose that the performance of interoceptive-allostatic circuitry is monitored by a metacognitive layer that updates beliefs about the brain's capacity to successfully regulate bodily states (allostatic self-efficacy). In this framework, fatigue and depression can be understood as sequential responses to the interoceptive experience of dyshomeostasis and the ensuing metacognitive diagnosis of low allostatic self-efficacy. While fatigue might represent an early response with adaptive value (cf. sickness behaviour), the experience of chronic dyshomeostasis may trigger a generalised belief of low self-efficacy and lack of control (cf. learned helplessness), resulting in depression. This perspective implies alternative pathophysiological mechanisms that are reflected by differential abnormalities in the effective connectivity of circuits for interoception and allostasis. We discuss suitably extended models of effective connectivity that could distinguish these connectivity patterns in individual patients and may help inform differential diagnosis of fatigue in the future.},

To fill this lacuna, the factor structure of the 16 primary and secondary subtests of the WISC-V standardization sample was examined with exploratory bifactor analysis (EBFA). EBFA results provided strong support for a general intelligence (g) factor, but nominal evidence for three group factors (i.e., Processing Speed, Working Memory, and Perceptual Reasoning). There was no evidence for distinct verbal, fluid reasoning or visual-spatial factors. The g factor accounted for large portions of total and common subtest variance while the group factors accounted for negligible portions of total and common variance.

abstract = {Padesky and Mooney's four-step Strengths-Based cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) model is designed to help clients build positive qualities. This article shows how it can be used to build and strengthen personal resilience. A structured search for client strengths is central to the approach, and methods designed to bring hidden strengths into client awareness are demonstrated through therapist-client dialogues. Development of positive qualities requires a shift in therapy perspective and different therapy methods from those employed when therapy is designed to ameliorate distress. Required adjustments to classic CBT are highlighted with specific recommendations for clinical modifications designed to support client development of resilience such as a focus on current strengths, the constructive use of imagery and client-generated metaphors. Although the focus of this article is on resilience, this Strengths-Based CBT model offers a template that also can be used to develop other positive human qualities.},

abstract = {While theory and research on leaders and leadership abound, followers and followership theory have been given short shrift. It is accepted wisdom that there is no leadership without followers, yet followers are very often left out of the leadership research equation. Fortunately this problem is being addressed in recent research, with more attention being paid to the role of followership in the leadership process. The purpose of this article is to provide a systematic review of the followership literature, and from this review, introduce a broad theory of followership into leadership research. Based on our review, we identify two theoretical frameworks for the study of followership, one from a role-based approach ("reversing the lens") and one from a constructionist approach ("the leadership process"). These frameworks are used to outline directions for future research. We conclude with a discussion of conceptual and methodological issues in the study of followership theory. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Attachment theory postulates that early life experiences have an enduring effect on personal-ity organization and thereby exert an infl uence on the development of personality disorders (PDs), either increasing or buffering risk. The effect of early experiences on adult personality is thought to be mediated by cognitive-affective mental structures known as attachment representa-tions or, in Bowlby's (1988) terminology, internal working models. For heuristic purposes, such working models are either positive or negative, and they can refer either to the self or to other people. Through repeated experiences with their caregivers that help is readily and consistently available at times of distress, children learn that they are worthy of attention and that others are reliable sources of nurturance. Such benevolent experiences are refl ected over time in the emergence of secure attachment patterns, characterized by positive models of self and others. Inconsistent experiences of care or consistent rejection, neglect, or abuse, however, are thought to give rise to more problematic internal working models: others come to be viewed as emotion-ally irrelevant or malevolent, and the self as unworthy of attention and care. As we described previously (Meyer {\&} Pilkonis, 2005), internal working models can be viewed as complex patterns of cognitive and affective processes that are differentially activated in specifi c types of circumstances and, by their recursive activation, guide experience and behavior in inter-personal situations. These cognitive-affective processes include, for example, the way interper-sonal experiences are encoded and interpreted, expectations of how such experiences will unfold over time, affective evaluations of interpersonal encounters, the implications one deduces from such events, and the goals, scripts, and intentions that are formed in response to interpersonal cues. This construal of attachment representations is consistent with contemporary models of per-sonality functioning, such as the Cognitive-Affective Personality Systems model (Mischel, 2009). Another assumption of an attachment approach to PDs is that many of these goals, scripts, expec-tations, and affective responses develop in early-life relationships, become overlearned, and later operate implicitly, outside of conscious awareness and volitional control. Variants of self-and other-representations may correspond to the different PDs exemplifi ed in current classifi cation systems, much in the same way that particular kinds of underlying beliefs are thought to be disorder-specifi c in cognitive models of psychopathology (Beck et al., 2001). In previous work, we attempted to describe how attachment processes in early life can give rise to the full spectrum of PD pathology (Meyer {\&} Pilkonis, 2005). In this chapter, we focus on narcissistic PD (NPD), which can be described prototypically as a refl ection of dismissing attachment, char-acterized by infl ated internal working models of the self (the self viewed as superior but unac-knowledged) and negative models of others (others viewed as failing to provide the unconditional devotion that is felt to be deserved; Meyer {\&} Pilkonis, 2005). We start out by providing a brief overview of NPD and its potential subtypes as viewed from the perspective of attachment theory. We review pertinent empirical fi ndings and then present recommendations for psychotherapeutic treatment that emerge from an attachment-based understanding of NPD.},

abstract = {Quantitative EEG (QEEG) is a reliable, objective, clinically-sensitive, and inexpensive method to evaluate the effects of rapid acceleration/deceleration injuries to the brain. Reduced EEG power in the higher frequencies, and frontal and temporal changes in coherence and phase are the most consistently reported changes in the QEEG following traumatic brain injury. Clinical correlations between the QEEG and neuropsychological test performance, length of coma, Glascow coma score, post-traumatic amnesia, and MRI biophysical measures are all convergent and systematic, and can be relied upon to help determine the degree of brain injury and likely affects on cognitive functioning. Repeat QEEG testing does not result in a “learning effect” as occurs with repeated neuropsychological testing, and repeat QEEG testing can be nearly in real-time. Follow-up QEEG measures can help evaluate the rate and extent of recovery from trauma in paralyzed and immobile patients. Finally, QEEG biofeedback is a procedure that is increasingly used to ameliorate the effects of brain injury, especially mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological and other clinical measures are important, and integration with other imaging modalities is encouraged and made easy using high speed desktop computers.},

abstract = {Past research has repeatedly identified relations between optimal experience— or flow—and well-being across the lifespan. In the attempt to identify the conditions favoring this experience, some studies took into account personality traits. While most of them operationalized flow in terms of intensity, we presently focused on perceived occurrence versus absence of flow. Specifically, we investigated the relations between flow occurrence, hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, activities associated with flow, and per-sonality in adolescence. A group of 408 Italian teenagers (mean age = 17.31; SD = 1.13) were administered Flow Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Psychological Well-being Scales, and the Big Five Questionnaire. Par-ticipants reporting optimal experience in their lives were compared with those not reporting it. Results showed that adolescents experiencing flow reported higher satisfaction with life, hedonic balance, and psychological well-being than their counterparts. Findings from logistic regression analyses further showed that openness to experience was the sole personality factor predicting flow occurrence, and that no personality factors were pre-dictive of type of activities adolescents associated with flow. Findings point to the pro-motion of optimal experience among adolescents through the support of curiosity and openness to new experiences in engaging opportunities for action. They further call for the development of an integrated model taking into account both individual predispositions and social and cultural factors in well-being promotion.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cognitive behaviour therapy delivered in the format of guided self-help via the internet has been found to be effective for a range of conditions, including depression and anxiety disorders. Recent results indicate that guided self-help via the internet is a promising treatment format also for psychodynamic therapy. However, to date and to our knowledge, no study has evaluated internet-delivered psychodynamic therapy as a transdiagnostic treatment. The affect-phobia model of psychopathology by McCullough et al provides a psychodynamic conceptualisation of a range of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study will be to test the effects of a transdiagnostic guided self-help treatment based on the affect-phobia model in a sample of clients with depression and anxiety.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be a randomised controlled trial with a total sample size of 100 participants. The treatment group receives a 10-week, psychodynamic, guided self-help treatment based on the transdiagnostic affect-phobia model of psychopathology. The treatment consists of eight text-based treatment modules and includes therapist contact in a secure online environment. Participants in the control group receive similar online therapist support without any treatment modules. Outcome measures are the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale and the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Process measures that concerns emotional processing and mindfulness are included. All outcome and process measures will be administered weekly via the internet and at 6-month follow-up.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: This trial will add to the body of knowledge on internet-delivered psychological treatments in general and to psychodynamic treatments in particular. We also hope to provide new insights in the effectiveness and working mechanisms of psychodynamic therapy based on the affect-phobia model.},

abstract = {Interest in the relationship between neural functions and emotions has focused particularly on comparisons of activation in the left and right dorsolateral frontal cortices. Beginning with the investigations of Davidson and colleagues, the alpha EEG frequency has been used as a measure of hypoactivity, and there has been general agreement among researchers that mood is more positive when the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is more hypoactive than the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. A practical application of this theoretical approach was developed when Dr. J. Peter Rosenfeld and colleagues designed an experiment in which they demonstrated that cortical asymmetry (A-score) could be modified in normal subjects by using a simple operant conditioning program. Their findings, in which nine of 13 subjects were successfully trained, were replicated by Allen et al. (2001). Encouraged by these results, neurofeedback protocols were developed to try with a small group of clinical patients who were suffering from various mood disorders. This chapter reviews the extensive theoretical literature that has been published since Davidson's original investigations. It reviews the results of the Baehr group's first study, and presents follow-up data from one to 10 years post-therapy. In addition, it reports on studies utilizing the asymmetry protocol to study shifts in mood, and on studies of asymmetry changes in women who suffer from premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It also reports on other asymmetry protocols designed to alleviate depression.},

abstract = {Rating scales that assess methodological quality of clinical trials provide a means to critically appraise the literature. Scales are currently available to rate random-ised and non-randomised controlled trials, but there are none that assess single-subject designs. The Single-Case Experimental Design (SCED) Scale was developed for this purpose and evaluated for reliability. Six clinical researchers who were trained and experienced in rating methodological quality of clinical trials developed the scale and participated in reliability studies. The SCED Scale is an 11-item rating scale for single-subject designs, of which 10 items are used to assess methodological quality and use of statistical analysis. The scale was developed and refined over a 3-year period. Content validity was addressed by identifying items to reduce the main sources of bias in single-case methodology as stipulated by authorities in the field, which were empirically tested against 85 published reports. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using a random sample of 20/312 single-subject reports archived in the Psychological Database of Brain Impairment Treatment Efficacy (PsycBITE TM). Inter-rater reliability for the total score was excellent, both for individual raters (overall ICC ¼ 0.84; 95{\%} confi-dence interval 0.73–0.92) and for consensus ratings between pairs of raters (overall ICC ¼ 0.88; 95{\%} confidence interval 0.78–0.95). Item reliability was fair to excellent for consensus ratings between pairs of raters (range k ¼ 0.48 to 1.00). The results were replicated with two independent novice raters who were trained in the use of the scale (ICC ¼ 0.88, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.73–0.95). The SCED Scale thus provides a brief and valid evaluation of meth-odological quality of single-subject designs, with the total score demonstrating excellent inter-rater reliability using both individual and consensus ratings. Items from the scale can also be used as a checklist in the design, reporting and critical appraisal of single-subject designs, thereby assisting to improve standards of single-case methodology.},

This report analyses the strengths and challenges facing the Swedish school system from an international perspective, and provides a number of recommendations and policy actions to strengthen it. It highlights the need for a comprehensive education reform that will bring about system-wide change and raise the performance of all Swedish schools and their students. The reform should define priorities, establish clear responsibilities across the system, and consistently provide the appropriate support and challenge to schools, municipalities and private organisers in their efforts of improvement. This report will be valuable not only for Sweden, but also other education systems looking to raise their performance.},

abstract = {This chapter addresses the question of how to classify the neuromodulation effects resulting from widely differing neurofeedback approaches developed over the last four decades. A proliferation of targets and objectives has been observed to which attention is directed in the training. With regard to clinical outcomes, however, one encounters a broad zone of commonality. Why is it that the premises and technological approaches within the neurofeedback network of scholars and clinicians are so disparate, yet they largely achieve common clinical goals? This in-depth analysis may lead one closer to the “essence” of neurofeedback and provide focus for further development efforts. This chapter attempts to appraise the “state of the field” at this moment. The objective is to discern the commonalities among the various approaches on the one hand, and among the clinical findings on the other. This will lead to a codification of a “minimal set of claims” that could serve to cover the commonalities among the techniques, and it will lead to a simple classification scheme for the various clinical findings. The evidence in favor of such a minimal set of claims will be adduced largely by reference.},

@article{Sautter2006,
abstract = {In Verbal Behavior, Skinner (1957) provided a conceptual framework and taxonomy for the controlling variables of language that defined independent verbal operants by their functional relations to antecedents and consequences (rather than by topography or meaning). Although professional interest in this area has recently increased within the behavior analytic community, Skinner's conceptual framework may not yet have fully impacted the experimental literature. This quantitative review of the literature examined the studies on verbal behavior that were empirical in nature, concerned with human verbal behavior, and addressed at least one verbal operant (e.g., mand, tact, echoic, autoclitic, and/or intraverbal behavior) within the experiment. The results of this review suggest that a growing body of research exists to support many of the tenets of Skinner's conceptualization and taxonomy but many areas of verbal behavior re-search have yet to be addressed. Continued research in this area is crucial for the development and imple-mentation of effective verbal behavior interventions for people with disabilities.},

abstract = {Place-based approaches to community change have become increasingly popular strategies for addressing significant social problems. With their intentional focus on 'place,' most efforts have sought to gain greater understanding into how neighborhood contexts affect people. However, while both aggregate characteristics and social dynamics of neighborhoods have been subject to scrutiny in the literature, less attention has been paid to understanding how the environmental characteristics of neighborhoods and communities as places have meaning for residents. The present study used an innovative methodology called Photovoice to obtain a greater understanding of the meanings residents ascribe to the salient characteristics of their neighborhoods and communities. As part of a place-based initiative, 29 adult and youth resi-dents in seven distressed urban neighborhoods photographed and dialogued about the mean-ingful physical attributes of their community. According to participants, place characteristics provided cues about their personal histories as members of the community; communicated messages about the value and character of the community and its residents; defined social norms and behavior within the community; and provided markers that could remind residents of who they are and inspire a sense of possibility for who they could become. Implications for practice are discussed. Within the last 15 years, many major founda-tions and other funding sources have funded compre-hensive community change efforts focused on partic-ular places (e.g., specific urban neighborhoods) that have targeted a range of social issues including ed-ucational success, youth and family well-being, com-munity health, employment, and poverty. While they vary greatly in their scope and targeted outcomes, these place-based initiatives all recognize geographi-cally bounded areas such as neighborhoods as targets of intervention and seek to transform such places into contexts with greater capacity to support youth and families (Gibson, Kingsley, {\&} McNeely, 1997).},

abstract = {School refusal behavior is a difficult problem faced by many parents, educators, and mental health professionals. A functional model to guide classification, assessment, and treatment of this population has evolved in recent years. In this article, step-by-step recommendations are made for synthesizing assessment information from a particular case toward the development and confirmation of a functional hypothesis. An illustrative example is also provided. School refusal behavior is a pernicious problem that disrupts the lives of many children and families and can lead to damaging short-and long-term consequences. In a previous article, the characteristics and functional assessment of school refusal behavior were outlined (Kearney, Lemos, {\&} Silverman, 2004). The reader is also referred to other sources for general information about this population as well as our functional model (Kearney, 2001; 2003; 2005; Kearney {\&} Albano, 2000; Kearney {\&} Silverman, 1996). In this article, we discuss steps for synthesizing assessment materials to assign appropriate, prescriptive treatment for a particular child with school refusal behavior. An illustrative case example is also provided. According to the functional model, school refusal behavior is generally maintained by one or more of the following conditions: • To avoid school-based stimuli that provoke a general sense of negative affectivity (anxiety and depression) • To escape aversive school-based social and/or evaluative situations • To pursue attention from significant others • To pursue tangible reinforcers outside of school • Functional assessment of this population generally involves interviews, child self-report and parent/teacher measures, direct observations, and consultations with school officials to determine which of these reasons are primary and secondary for a particular child who refuses school (see Kearney et al., 2004). Information is thus collected from multiple sources about multiple areas of functioning. A clinician is then faced with the task of integrating this information to generate hypotheses about maintaining functions of school refusal behavior, or to derive a functional profile. We recommend several steps in this process.},

Participants with lower moral judgment competence recruited the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the left posterior superior temporal sulcus more than participants with greater competence in this domain when identifying social norm violations. Moreover, moral judgment competence scores were inversely correlated with activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during socio-normative relative to grammatical judgments.

The highly conserved stress hormone response influences many brain regions, particularly the hippocampus, a region important for memory function. The effect of acute stress on the unique population of adult neural stem/ progenitor cells (NPCs) that resides in the adult hippocampus is unclear. We found that acute stress increased hippocampal cell proliferation and astrocytic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression. The effect of acute stress occurred independent of basolateral amygdala neural input and was mimicked by treating isolated NPCs with conditioned media from corticosterone-treated primary astrocytes. Neutralization of FGF2 revealed that astrocyte-secreted FGF2 mediated stress-hormone-induced NPC proliferation. 2 weeks, but not 2 days, after acute stress, rats also showed enhanced fear extinction memory coincident with enhanced activation of newborn neurons. Our findings suggest a beneficial role for brief stress on the hippocampus and improve understanding of the adaptive capacity of the brain.},

abstract = {The scientific legacy of Paul MacLean provides important insights into the neural substrate of adaptive social behavior in mammals. Through his research and visionary conceptualizations, current investigators can legitimately study social behavior from a neurobiological perspective. His research and writings provided three important contributions. First, he emphasized the importance of evolution as an organizing principle that shaped both the structure of the nervous system and the adaptive social behavior. Second, by defining the limbic system, he legitimized the biological perspective in the study of emotion. Third, he recognized the important role of the vagal afferents in the regulation of higher brain structures. The paper will focus on the Polyvagal Theory. The Polyvagal Theory is a new conceptualization of the role of vagus and employs several features that MacLean emphasized including the importance of evolution, limbic structures and vagal afferents. The Polyvagal Theory builds on these early findings by MacLean and focuses on the link between phylogenetic changes in the autonomic nervous system and social behavior. By focusing on the phylogenetic changes in the structure of the vagus and the role that the vagus plays in the neural regulation of visceral state, new insights regarding social behavior emerge. Moreover, by articulating the phylogenetically organized hierarchy of neural circuits, insights into benefits of social behavior become evident as do an understanding of the behavioral and physiological features associated with stress and psychiatric disorders. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Successful control of affect partly depends on the capacity to modulate negative emotional responses through the use of cognitive strategies (i.e., reappraisal). Recent studies suggest the involvement of frontal cortical regions in the modulation of amygdala reactivity and the mediation of effective emotion regulation. However, within-subject inter-regional connectivity between amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the context of affect regulation is unknown. Here, using psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we show that activity in specific areas of the frontal cortex (dorsolateral, dorsal medial, anterior cingulate, orbital) covaries with amygdala activity and that this functional connectivity is dependent on the reappraisal task. Moreover, strength of amygdala coupling with orbitofrontal cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex predicts the extent of attenuation of negative affect following reappraisal. These findings highlight the importance of functional connectivity within limbic-frontal circuitry during emotion regulation.},

abstract = {{\&} Some involvement of the human amygdala in the process-ing of facial expressions has been investigated in neuroimaging studies, although the neural mechanisms underlying motivated or emotional behavior in response to facial stimuli are not yet fully understood. We investigated, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and healthy volunteers, how the amygdala interacts with other cortical regions while subjects are judging the sex of faces with negative, positive, or neutral emotion. The data were analyzed by a subtractive method, then, to clarify possible interaction among regions within the brain, several kinds of analysis (i.e., a correlation analysis, a psychophysiological interaction analysis and a structural equation modeling) were performed. Overall, significant activation was observed in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, medial temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, and the right parietal lobe during the task. The results of subtraction between the conditions showed that the left amygdala, right orbitofrontal cortex, and temporal cortices were predominantly involved in the processing of the negative expressions. The right angular gyrus was involved in the processing of the positive expressions when the negative condition was subtracted from the positive condition. The correlation analysis showed that activity in the left amygdala positively correlated with activity in the left prefrontal cortex under the negative minus neutral subtraction condition. The psychophysiological interaction revealed that the neural responses in the left amygdala and the right prefrontal cortex underwent the condition-specific changes between the negative and positive face conditions. The right amygdaloid activity also had an interactive effect with activity in the right hippocampus and middle temporal gyrus. These results may suggest that the left and right amygdalae play a differential role in effective processing of facial expressions in collaboration with other cortical or subcortical regions, with the left being related with the bilateral prefrontal cortex, and the right with the right temporal lobe. {\&}},

My views over the past 40 years have changed radically from my initial view (Ekman, 1957) that: (a) a pleasantunpleasant and activepassive scale were sufficient to capture the differences among emotions; and (b) the relationship between a facial configuration and what it signified is socially learned and culturally variable. I was forced to adopt the opposite view by findings from my own and others crosscultural studies of facial expressions. There are some who have challenged this by now quite large body of evidence: I describe those challenges and the answers to them in Chapter 16. The framework I describe below is most influenced by Darwin (1872/1997) and Tomkins (1962), although I do not accept in total what either said. There are three meanings of the term basic (see also Ortony {\&} Turner, 1990). First, it distinguishes those who maintain that there are a number of separate emotions, that differ one from another in important ways. From this perspective, fear, anger, disgust, sadness and contempt, all negative emotions, differ in their appraisal, antecedent events, probable behavioral response, physiology and other characteristics described below. So, too, amusement, pride in achievement, satisfaction, relief and contentment, all positive emotions, differ from each other. This basic emotions perspective is in contrast to those who treat emotions as fundamentally the same, differing only in terms of intensity or pleasantness.},

abstract = {The neural processes underlying the ability to divide attention between multiple sensory modalities remain poorly understood. To investigate the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in bimodal divided attention, we completed two repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) studies. We tested the hypothesis that the DLPFC is necessary in the ability to divide attention across modalities. This hypothesis originated as a result of a previous fMRI study in which the posterior DLPFC was active during a bimodal divided attention condition [Johnson, J. A., {\&} Zatorre, R. J. Neural substrates for dividing and focusing attention between simultaneous auditory and visual events. Neuroimage, 2006]. In the current experiments, two separate groups of subjects underwent 10 min of slow rTMS to temporarily disrupt function of the DLPFC. In both groups, the ability to divide attention between unrelated auditory and visual stimuli decreased following DLPFC disruption compared to control site stimulation. Specifically, the ability to divide attention between modalities was hindered, leading to a pattern of behavior similar to bimodal selective attention (ability to attend to one or the other modality but not both). We discuss possible roles of the posterior DLPFC in bimodal divided attention and conclude that the area may be functioning to support the increased working memory load associated with divided, compared to selective attention.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that acute psychosocial stress impairs recognition of declarative memory and that emotional material is especially sensitive to this effect. Animal studies suggest a central role of the amygdala which modulates memory processes in hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and other brain areas. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural correlates of stress-induced modulation of emotional recognition memory in humans. Twenty-seven healthy, right-handed, non-smoker male volunteers performed an emotional face recognition task. During encoding, participants were presented with 50 fearful and 50 neutral faces. One hour later, they underwent either a stress (Trier Social Stress Test) or a control procedure outside the scanner which was followed immediately by the recognition session inside the scanner, where participants had to discriminate between 100 old and 50 new faces. Stress increased salivary cortisol, blood pressure and pulse, and decreased the mood of participants but did not impact recognition memory. BOLD data during recognition revealed a stress condition by emotion interaction in the left inferior frontal gyrus and right hippocampus which was due to a stress-induced increase of neural activity to fearful and a decrease to neutral faces. Functional connectivity analyses revealed a stress-induced increase in coupling between the right amygdala and the right fusiform gyrus, when processing fearful as compared to neutral faces. Our results provide evidence that acute psychosocial stress affects medial temporal and frontal brain areas differentially for neutral and emotional items, with a stress-induced privileged processing of emotional stimuli.},

abstract = {This paper describes a protocol for induction of moderate psychological stress in a laboratory setting and evaluates its effects on physiological responses. The 'Trier Social Stress Test' (TSST) mainly consists of an anticipation period (10 min) and a test period (10 min) in which the subjects have to deliver a free speech and perform mental arithmetic in front of an audience. In six independent studies this protocol has been found to induce considerable changes in the concentration of ACTH, cortisol (serum and saliva), GH, prolactin as well as significant increases in heart rate. As for salivary cortisol levels, the TSST reliably led to 2- to 4-fold elevations above baseline with similar peak cortisol concentrations. Studies are summarized in which TSST-induced cortisol increases elucidated some of the multiple variables contributing to the interindividual variation in adrenocortical stress responses. The results suggest that gender, genetics and nicotine consumption can influence the individual's stress responsiveness to psychological stress while personality traits showed no correlation with cortisol responses to TSST stimulation. From these data we conclude that the TSST can serve as a tool for psychobiological research.},

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to contribute to assertiveness research and assess the differences in assertiveness as it relates to gender, national culture, and ethnicity. Design/methodology/approach – The data for the study are from 231 undergraduate students majoring in business at one of four academic institutions: three in the USA and one in the Republic of Vietnam. Students completed the 30-item Rathus Assertiveness Schedule. Findings – This research suggests that individuals who are alike in level of education and status demonstrate similar levels of assertiveness, regardless of gender, national culture, or ethnicity. However, differences were seen as the data show white American males to be the most assertive, with African American females next. White females ranked third, followed by Vietnamese females, concluding with Vietnamese males. Research limitations/implications – Although the sample size is small, the intent of this research was never to have the subjects represent the general population in terms of the variables used. Instead, the authors attempted to control for gender, culture, and ethnicity variables by using a sample of college students who were similar in relation to education and social status. Future research could more fully research the findings from this study which suggest that African American women are more assertive than all other groups with the exception of white males. Originality/value – This study also gives credence to the suggestion that the global manager, in order to become more effective, needs to fully understand employee differences as represented by gender, national culture, and ethnicity.},

abstract = {The Scale for Interpersonal Behaviour (SIB), a multidimensional, self-report measure of state assertiveness, was administered to a nationwide sample of 2375 undergraduates enrolled at 11 colleges and universities across the USA. The SIB was developed in the Netherlands for the independent assessment of both distress associated with self-assertion in a variety of social situations and the likelihood of engaging in a specific assertive response. This is done with four factorially-derived, first-order dimensions: (i) Display of negative feelings (Negative assertion); (ii) Expression of and dealing with personal limitations; (iii) Initiating assertiveness; and (iv) Praising others and the ability to deal with compliments/praise of others (Positive assertion). The present study was designed to determine the cross-national invariance of the original Dutch factors and the construct validity of the corresponding dimensions. It also set out to develop norms for a nationwide sample of US students. The results provide further support for the reliability, factorial and construct validity of the SIB. Compared to their Dutch equivalents, US students had meaningfully higher distress in assertiveness scores on all SIB scales (medium to large effect sizes), whereas differences on the performance scales reflected small effect sizes. The cross-national differences in distress scores were hypothesized to have originated from the American culture being more socially demanding with respect to interpersonal competence than the Dutch, and from the perceived threats and related cognitive appraisals that are associated with such demands.

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to contribute to assertiveness research and assess the differences in assertiveness as it relates to gender, national culture, and ethnicity. Design/methodology/approach – The data for the study are from 231 undergraduate students majoring in business at one of four academic institutions: three in the USA and one in the Republic of Vietnam. Students completed the 30-item Rathus Assertiveness Schedule. Findings – This research suggests that individuals who are alike in level of education and status demonstrate similar levels of assertiveness, regardless of gender, national culture, or ethnicity. However, differences were seen as the data show white American males to be the most assertive, with African American females next. White females ranked third, followed by Vietnamese females, concluding with Vietnamese males. Research limitations/implications – Although the sample size is small, the intent of this research was never to have the subjects represent the general population in terms of the variables used. Instead, the authors attempted to control for gender, culture, and ethnicity variables by using a sample of college students who were similar in relation to education and social status. Future research could more fully research the findings from this study which suggest that African American women are more assertive than all other groups with the exception of white males. Originality/value – This study also gives credence to the suggestion that the global manager, in order to become more effective, needs to fully understand employee differences as represented by gender, national culture, and ethnicity.},

This is an essential social skill for adolescent development and seems to encompass emotional, behavioral, and cognitive aspects. The instrument was created by combining both empirical and theoretical methods for item construction, aiming to evaluate the cognitive realm of assertiveness. A sample of 996 adolescent students was used to test for reliability and validity. Results indicate good psychometric properties. The instrument is composed of 4 subscales: Outer Emotional Support, Functional Personal Ability, Interpersonal Management, and Affective Personal Ability. The Assertive Interpersonal Schema Questionnaire may potentially be a useful tool in the diagnosis of, understanding of, and development of a treatment plan for individuals with persistent difficulties in social events.},

abstract = {Diminished assertiveness has been associated with neuroticism, depression, and anxiety. Although many assertiveness instruments have been developed for research and clinical purposes, one common shortcoming is a lack of discriminant validity with regard to aggression. Further, the wording of many instruments is outdated and discriminatory. The goal of the present research was to develop a more sensitive instrument measuring two distinguishable forms of assertiveness: adaptive assertiveness and aggressive assertiveness. We present data validating such a measure, the Adaptive and Aggressive Assertiveness Scales (AAA-S). Participants included two samples of college students and a clinical sample of adults with anxiety disorders. The AAA-S demonstrated good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The aggressive assertiveness scale was associated with various forms of aggression and peer reports of aggressive assertiveness. The adaptive assertiveness scale was associated with competence and peer reports of adaptive assertiveness. Importantly, there were no gender differences in adaptive assertiveness. Clinical implications are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {There is scholarly disagreement about whether Asian Americans are more socially anxious and less assertive than European Americans. We examined this question by exploring the interrela- tions among race/ethnicity, social anxiety, assertiveness, and self-beliefs related to mood regula- tion and sense of self. Participants were 72 Asian Americans and 63 European Americans who completed measures assessing negative mood regulation expectancies (NMRE), self-construal, social anxiety, and assertiveness. Moderated regression analyses revealed that independent self-construal, a self-belief, predicted both social anxiety and assertiveness regardless of partic- ipant race/ethnicity. Also, less social anxiety predicted more assertiveness, regardless of one's NMRE, also a self-belief. The most powerful predictors of assertiveness were social anxiety and self-construal. These findings suggest that when working with clients experiencing concerns about social anxiety or assertiveness, mental health counselors should explore their clients' self-beliefs, regardless of whether clients are Asian American or European American.},

Randomised trials have become the gold standard to prove that interventions are effective, and they are used by treatment guidelines and policy makers to decide whether or not to adopt, implement or fund a therapy. Methods.: You would want to do such a randomised trial to get your therapy disseminated, but in reality your clinical experience already showed you that the therapy works. How could you do a trial in order to optimise the chance of finding a positive effect? Results.: Methods that can help include a strong allegiance towards the therapy, anything that increases expectations and hope in participants, making use of the weak spots of randomised trials (risk of bias), small sample sizes and waiting list control groups (but not comparisons with existing interventions).

The clinical series comprised 115 patients with social phobia and 51 patients with personality disorder, 28 of whom were of the avoidant type. Support was found for internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the French SIB. Compared to controls, both social phobics and patients with an avoidant personality disorder had significantly lower mean scores on all performance scales and significantly higher ones on all distress scales, with the social phobics occupying a position in between. Findings in relation to convergent and divergent validity were quite satisfactory. Sensitivity of the French SIB for detecting change was demonstrated in a subgroup of the clinical Ss who had undergone 15 sessions of cognitive-behavioral group therapy for underassertiveness.

Functional assertiveness is a new concept of assertiveness that represents a method of appropriate self-expression. Functional assertiveness is defined as interpersonal communication that occurs when a speaker encounters interpersonal problems that should be resolved or has objectives that should be achieved, and the speaker's message is perceived as appropriate by the listener (Mitamura {\&} Tanaka-Matsumi, 2010, 2010c). Five studies were conducted in order to develop the FAS. In Study 1, we generated an item pool for FAS, and in Study 2 we developed the FAS prototype using this item pool. Study 3 examined the factorial validity, concurrent validity, and internal consistency of the FAS. Study 4 examined test–retest reliability of the FAS. Study 5 examined responsiveness on the FAS.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Autonomy-connectedness (self-awareness, sensitivity to others, and capacity for managing new situations) reflects the capacity for self-governance, including in social relationships. Evidence showed that autonomy-connectedness is related to anxiety and depression. Little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We hypothesized that alexithymia and assertiveness would mediate the relationships between autonomy-connectedness and anxiety and depression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: Relationships among the variables were investigated in 100 patients with a mean age of 42.2 suffering from anxiety and/or depression using a cross-sectional design.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The relationship between self-awareness and both anxiety and depression was mediated by alexithymia. For anxiety, there was also a direct effect of sensitivity to others that was not explained by either alexithymia or assertiveness. Assertiveness did not have any mediational effect.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that particularly alexithymia explains the association of autonomy-connectedness with anxiety and depression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRACTITIONER POINTS: The study confirmed the relevance of autonomy-connectedness in anxiety and depression. In treating symptoms of anxiety, it is advisable to give attention to normalizing the patient's sensitivity to others. Treatment of patients with symptoms of anxiety and depression should include assessment of emotional awareness and, in the case of impaired emotional awareness, should be tailored as to promote increased awareness.},

abstract = {Anxiety disorders (separation anxiety disorder, selective mutism, specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and generalised anxiety disorder) are common and disabling conditions that mostly begin during childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. They differ from developmentally normative or stress-induced transient anxiety by being marked (ie, out of proportion to the actual threat present) and persistent, and by impairing daily functioning. Most anxiety disorders affect almost twice as many women as men. They often co-occur with major depression, alcohol and other substance-use disorders, and personality disorders. Differential diagnosis from physical conditions—including thyroid, cardiac, and respiratory disorders, and substance intoxication and withdrawal—is imperative. If untreated, anxiety disorders tend to recur chronically. Psychological treatments, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy, and pharmacological treatments, particularly selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and serotonin–noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitors, are effective, and their combination could be more effective than is treatment with either individually. More research is needed to increase access to and to develop personalised treatments.},

The online platform, called Iterapi, was developed at the Department of Behavioural Sciences and Learning at Link{\"{o}}ping University, Sweden and has been running for nearly two decades and used in many randomized controlled trials and outpatient treatments. The intention of this article is to share our experience with developing such a treatment solution and the process flow and elements of running internet-based psychological interventions. This will likely be of use to developers building similar services, therapists considering integrating such approaches in their practices and institutions, as well as researchers curious about the functions included on the platform and methodology used for running studies. We describe the security aspects of the platform, central concepts underlying its development, how the platform can be used in a study or treatment and the main features and functions the platform offers. We comment on practical considerations regarding blending of methods within the platform, such as self-help treatments with asynchronous communication and real-time text chat and video conversations. We also point out the advantages of using Internet-assisted treatments, the challenges that we have faced and future planned upgrades. Due to continuous development of the platform, its user-friendliness, accessibility across devices and numerous features, many research colleagues from Sweden as well as other countries such as Germany, United Kingdom, Romania and Israel have chosen to implement their own studies on the platform.},

However, research investigating different treatment interventions is scarce, and no randomized controlled trial has examined the efficacy of cognitivea 'behavior therapy (CBT). Meanwhile, Internet-based CBT has been found promising for several conditions, but has not yet been used for procrastination. Method: Participants (N = 150) were randomized to guided self-help, unguided self-help, and wait-list control. Outcome measures were administered before and after treatment, or weekly throughout the treatment period. They included the Pure Procrastination Scale, the Irrational Procrastination Scale, the Susceptibility to Temptation Scale, the Montgomery {\AA}sberg Depression Rating Scale 'Self-report version, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment, and the Quality of Life Inventory. The intention-to-treat principle was used for all statistical analyses.

abstract = { Background. The clinician-administered version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS-CA) is a commonly used assessment device for the evaluation of social anxiety disorder and has been shown to have strong psychometric characteristics. Because of its apparently straightforward rating format and potential savings in time and effort, interest in the use of the LSAS as a self-report (LSAS-SR) measure has increased, and the LSAS-SR has been used in a number of studies. However, the psychometric properties of the LSAS-SR have not been well established.  Methods. This study examined the psychometric properties of the LSAS-SR in comparison to the LSAS-CA in a sample of 99 individuals with a primary diagnosis of social anxiety disorder and 53 individuals with no current psychiatric disorder.  Results. There was little difference between the two versions of the LSAS on any scale or subscale score. Both forms were internally consistent and the subscale intercorrelations for the two forms were essentially identical. Correlations of each LSAS-SR index with its LSAS-CA counterpart were all highly significant. Finally, the convergent and discriminant validity of the two forms of the LSAS was shown to be strong.  Conclusion. Results of this study suggest that the self-report version of the LSAS compares well to the clinician-administered version and may be validly employed in the assessment of social anxiety disorder. },

abstract = {Humans possess great capacity for behavioral and cultural change, but our ability to manage change is still limited. This article has two major objectives: first, to sketch a basic science of intentional change centered on evolution; second, to provide examples of intentional behavioral and cultural change from the applied behavioral sciences, which are largely unknown to the basic sciences community. All species have evolved mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity that enable them to respond adaptively to their environments. Some mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity count as evolutionary processes in their own right. The human capacity for symbolic thought provides an inheritance system having the same kind of combinatorial diversity as does genetic recombination and antibody formation. Taking these propositions seriously allows an integration of major traditions within the basic behavioral sciences, such as behaviorism, social constructivism, social psychology, cognitive psychology, and evolutionary psychology, which are often isolated and even conceptualized as opposed to one another. The applied behavioral sciences include well-validated examples of successfully managing behavioral and cultural change at scales ranging from individuals to small groups to large populations. However, these examples are largely unknown beyond their disciplinary boundaries, for lack of a unifying theoretical framework. Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, they are examples of managing evolved mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity, including open-ended processes of variation and selection. Once the many branches of the basic and applied behavioral sciences become conceptually unified, we are closer to a science of intentional change than one might think.},

Aims We aimed to provide evidence on whether enduring effects of psychotherapy differ from control groups. Method We searched 93 randomised controlled studies with 152 study arms of psychological treatment (cognitive-behavioural therapy or other psychotherapies) for panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder that included follow-up assessments. In a meta-Analysis, pre-post effect sizes for end-point and all follow-up periods were calculated and compared with control groups (medication: n = 16 study arms; pill and psychological placebo groups: n = 17 study arms). Results Gains with psychotherapy were maintained for up to 24 months. For cognitive-behavioural therapy, we observed a significant improvement over time. However, patients in the medication group remained stable during the treatment-free period, with no significant difference when compared with psychotherapy. Patients in the placebo group did not deteriorate during follow-up, but showed significantly worse outcomes than patients in cognitive-behavioural therapy. Conclusions Not only psychotherapy, but also medications and, to a lesser extent, placebo conditions have enduring effects. Long-lasting treatment effects observed in the follow-up period may be superimposed by effects of spontaneous remission or regression to the mean.

Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials over the past several decades have demonstrated very large effect sizes for exposure therapy for anxiety disorders, whether alone or combined with coping strategies such as cognitive reappraisal or breathing/relaxation training. Numerous strategies translated from basic fear learning research can be implemented during exposure to enhance inhibitory learning. These methods include enhancing inhibitory learning through: expectancy violation, removal of safety signals, attentional focus, deepened extinction, stimulus variability, occasional reinforced extinction, and enhancing retrieval of inhibitory learning via multiple contexts and retrieval cues. This chapter focuses on ways to implement and capitalize on these strategies within treatment to achieve superior extinction learning. Overall, the translation of inhibitory learning principles into exposure therapy is an exciting and critical step forward toward science-driven practice.

In addition, these methods have documented advantages over traditional data analytic approaches in the analysis of repeated-measures data. These advantages include, but are not limited to, the ability to incorporate time-varying predictors, handle dependence among repeated observations in a very flexible manner, and to provide accurate estimates with missing data under fairly unrestrictive missing data assumptions. The flexibility of the growth curve modeling approach to the analysis of change makes it the preferred choice in the evaluation of direct, indirect and moderated intervention effects. Although offering many benefits, growth models present challenges in terms of design, analysis and reporting of results. This paper provides a nontechnical overview of growth models in the analysis of change in randomized experiments and advocates for their use in the field of internet interventions.

abstract = {Given that countless studies have documented the wide-ranging benefits of self-regulation, determining if and how self-regulation can be improved is an important scientific and societal priority. Existing theories suggest that the deterioration of self-regulation is partially shaped by perceptions of effort. Therefore, one promising way to sustain self-regulation may be to cultivate a growth mindset, which has been shown to affect behavior in part by altering effort attributions. Although growth mindsets—the belief that a given trait can be improved through practice—have been studied extensively, particularly in the domain of intelligence, little research has examined the effects of promoting a growth mindset specifically about self-regulation. Here five studies test how promoting a growth mindset of self-regulation impacts actual self-regulation in daily life and the laboratory. In Study 1, relative to an active control that received relationship training, an intensive self-regulation training program emphasizing a growth mindset led participants to persevere longer on impossible anagrams, which was partially mediated by altering attributions of mental fatigue. Relatively, the self-regulation training also led participants to notice more opportunities for self-control in daily life and more successfully resist everyday temptations. The subsequent four studies isolated and abbreviated the growth mindset manipulation, demonstrated improved persistence and decreased effort avoidance, and attempted to further examine the critical mediators. Collectively, results indicate that a growth mindset of self-regulation can change attributions and allocation of effort in meaningful ways that may affect the willingness to attempt challenging tasks and the perseverance required to complete them.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heightened reactivity to unpredictable threat (U-threat) is a core individual difference factor underlying fear-based psychopathology. Little is known, however, about whether reactivity to U-threat is a stable marker of fear-based psychopathology or if it is malleable to treatment. The aim of the current study was to address this question by examining differences in reactivity to U-threat within patients before and after 12-weeks of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). METHODS: Participants included patients with principal fear (n = 22) and distress/misery disorders (n = 29), and a group of healthy controls (n = 21) assessed 12-weeks apart. A well-validated threat-of-shock task was used to probe reactivity to predictable (P-) and U-threat and startle eyeblink magnitude was recorded as an index of defensive responding. RESULTS: Across both assessments, individuals with fear-based disorders displayed greater startle magnitude to U-threat relative to healthy controls and distress/misery patients (who did not differ). From pre- to post-treatment, startle magnitude during U-threat decreased only within the fear patients who received CBT. Moreover, within fear patients, the magnitude of decline in startle to U-threat correlated with the magnitude of decline in fear symptoms. For the healthy controls, startle to U-threat across the two time points was highly reliable and stable. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results indicate that startle to U-threat characterizes fear disorder patients and is malleable to treatment with CBT but not SSRIs within fear patients. Startle to U-threat may therefore reflect an objective, psychophysiological indicator of fear disorder status and CBT treatment response.},

Recent research further suggests that mindsets about anxiety may act in a similar fashion with mental health resilience. In this study we examined whether anxiety mindset would moderate relations between history of stressful life events and psychological distress and coping. Consistent with predictions, relations between number of stressful life events and posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression, substance use, and motivations for non-suicidal self-injury were weaker among those with more of a growth mindset relative to those with more of a fixed mindset. These initial results suggest that anxiety mindsets function in a similar way for mental health resilience as how mindsets of intelligence function for academic outcomes.},

abstract = {Individuals avoid stimuli which are associated with aversive experience to preserve safety. However, behavioral avoidance also causes impairments and prevents the individual from attaining positive rewards. Little is known about the link between fear acquisition and the development of behavioral avoidance in the presence of potential rewards. Therefore, two experiments investigated the impact of fear conditioning on a subsequent gambling task. In an experimental group (n = 30) advantageous choices (higher reward probability) were linked to a fear-relevant stimulus that was associated with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) during fear conditioning (conditioned stimulus, CS+). A disadvantageous choice (lower reward probability) was, however, linked to a safe stimulus that was never associated with the US (CS-). In a control group (n = 25), fear conditioning was followed by a similar gambling task with novel stimuli. A second experiment focused on individual predictors of avoidant decisions (n = 81). Compared with the control group, individuals in the experimental groups avoided the advantageous CS + choice despite fewer gains. The predictor analysis further clarified that avoidant decisions were pronounced in highly trait anxious participants who exhibited higher fear responses. On the other hand, findings also indicated a reduction in absolute avoidance across the task. Combined, these findings demonstrate that fear conditioning can lead to avoidant decision making, especially in vulnerable individuals. The resulting costs parallel impairments caused by behavioral avoidance. Such an emotional decision-making style may be a link between aversive experience and the development of habitual pathological avoidance. Introducing rewards for approach, however, may counteract avoidant decisions.},

abstract = {Not only do anxiety and depression diagnoses tend to co-occur, but their symptoms are highly correlated. Although a plethora of research has examined longitudinal associations between anxiety and depression, these data have not yet been effectively synthesized. To address this need, the current study undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of 66 studies involving 88,336 persons examining the prospective relationship between anxiety and depression at both symptom and disorder levels. Using mixed-effect models, results suggested that all types of anxiety symptoms predicted later depressive symptoms (r ϭ .34), and all types of depressive symptoms predicted later anxiety symptoms (r ϭ .31). Although anxiety symptoms more strongly predicted depressive symptoms than vice versa, the difference in effect size for this analysis was very small and likely not clinically meaningful. Additionally, all types of diagnosed anxiety disorders predicted all types of later depressive disorders (OR ϭ 2.77), and all depressive disorders predicted later anxiety disorders (OR ϭ 2.73). Most anxiety and depressive disorders predicted each other with similar degrees of strength, but depressive disorders more strongly predicted social anxiety disorder (OR ϭ 6.05) and specific phobia (OR ϭ 2.93) than vice versa. Contrary to conclusions of prior reviews, our findings suggest that depressive disorders may be prodromes for social and specific phobia, whereas other anxiety and depressive disorders are bidirectional risk factors for one another. Public Significance Statement This meta-analysis suggests that anxiety and depression symptoms bidirectionally prospectively predict one another with moderate and similar strength. These prospective bidirectional relationships are stronger over shorter time periods and weaken over longer time periods. Most anxiety and depressive disorders significantly bidirectionally prospectively predicted one another with strong nonsignificantly different strength. However, depressive disorders more strongly predicted social and specific phobia than vice versa, suggesting that depressive disorders may be prodromes for social and specific phobia.},

Functional analysis is tightly connected to treatment but has failed to develop testable, replicable classification systems. Functional diagnostic dimensions are suggested as a way to develop the functional classification approach, and experiential avoidance is described as 1 such dimension. A wide range of research is reviewed showing that many forms of psychopathology can be conceptualized as unhealthy efforts to escape and avoid emotions, thoughts, memories, and other private experiences. It is argued that experiential avoidance, as a functional diagnostic dimension, has the potential to integrate the efforts and findings of researchers from a wide variety of theoretical paradigms, research interests, and clinical domains and to lead to testable new approaches to the analysis and treatment of behavioral disorders.},

In health care, assertiveness may play an important role in health outcomes, especially for predominantly minority populations, such as adults with sickle cell disease. Therefore, it is important to develop measures to accurately assess assertiveness. It is also important to reduce response burden of lengthy instruments while retaining instrument reliability and validity. The purpose of this article is to describe development of a shorter version of the Simple Rathus Assertiveness Schedule (SRAS). Design: Data from a cross-sectional descriptive study of adults with sickle cell disease were used to construct a short form of the SRAS, guided by stepwise regression analysis. Results: The 19-item Simple Rathus Assertiveness Scale'Short Form (SRAS-SF) had acceptable reliability ($\alpha$ =.81) and construct validity and was highly correlated with the SRAS (r =.98, p =.01). Conclusions: The SRAS-SF reduces response burden, while maintaining reliability and validity. {\textcopyright} 2010, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to introduce new ways to model the I-V characteristic of a photovoltaic (PV) cell or PV module using straight lines and B{\&}eacute;zier curves. This is a complete novel approach, B{\&}eacute;zier curves being previously used mainly for computer graphics. The I-V characteristic is divided into three sections, modeled with lines and a quadratic B{\&}eacute;zier curve in the first case and with three cubic B{\&}eacute;zier curves in the second case. The result proves to be accurate and relies on the fundamental points usually present in the PV cell datasheets: V o c (the open circuit voltage), I s c (the short circuit current), V m p (the maximum power corresponding voltage) and I m p (the maximum power corresponding current), and the parasitic resistances R s h 0 (shunt resistance at I s c ) and R s 0 (series resistance at V o c ). The proposed algorithm completely defines all the implied control points and the error is analyzed. The temperature and irradiance influence is also analyzed. The model is also compared using the least squares fitting method. The final validation shows how to use B{\&}eacute;zier cubic curves to accurately represent the I-V curves of an extensive range of PV cells and arrays.},

Belinda, a Year 12 student had come to see me. She told me that she was struggling with her personal marijuana usage — she was smoking it before school most days and after school every day. She had been seeing the visiting Ted Noff's Drug and Alcohol counsellor regularly, and was able to reel off to me all the reasons why she should stop smoking it — but she hadn't. She sat back, apparently waiting for me to give her some more reasons why she should stop. Instead, I suggested to her that one of the things that affected our behaviour was the kind of things our mind says to us — the thoughts we have about ourselves. I shared with her that my mind sometimes beats me up, and says some pretty harsh things about me, and I wondered if she had the same experience. Oh yes, she said, she had horrible thoughts about herself. I asked would it be okay for her to tell me some of the mean things her mind sometimes said? She started listing a few — dumb, boring . . . Then she said 'Fat'. I noticed her face changed as she admitted to this one. And what does her mind say about that? What does that mean? Her eyes filled with tears. 'It means I'm ugly,' she said. 'And what does your mind say that means?' I asked. 'That no one will ever love me,' she said. And she burst into tears. When she had recovered, we went on to explore her thoughts some more, and found that she frequently compared herself to her friends, and judged that she came up short, especially as far as looks went. In fact, the only time she didn't think about it, the only time she felt all right about herself, was . . . when she was smoking pot.},

abstract = {The following two chapters (9 and 10) by Hughes and Barnes‐Holmes in this part of the CBS handbook provide a very detailed and systematic review of relational frame theory (RFT) and its evidence. As such, there seems little point in recapitulating some of that work in this opening chapter of Part II. Furthermore, the subsequent two chapters provide examples of how RFT has been applied in the domains of educational (chapter 11, Barnes‐Holmes, Kavanagh, {\&} Murphy) and clinical psychology (chapter 12, T{\"{o}}rneke, Luciano, Barnes‐Holmes, {\&} Bond). The current part therefore provides a comprehensive overview of the basic and applied wings of RFT. By way of narrative or commentary, this opening chapter aims to provide a particular perspective, perhaps somewhat controversial at the present time, on the history and future development of the account itself. We begin here by asking the question: What are the historical and intellectual roots of RFT? The seminal volume contains a narrative by Steve Hayes, which addresses the origins of the theory from the personal perspective of the person who first conceptu­ alized the account (Hayes, Barnes‐Holmes, {\&} Roche, 2001). However, we are asking a broader and perhaps more fundamental question here. Why did Steve come up with RFT at that time? Or, in other words, what was the confluence of historical and intel­ lectual variables that led him to do so, and subsequently supported the theory's development and continued growth to this day? Here is our view on the matter.},

abstract = {Anxiety, depression and stress, often co-occurring, are the psychological problems for which university students most often seek help. Moreover there are many distressed students who cannot, or choose not to, access professional help. The present study evaluated the efficacy of an internet-based guided self-help program for moderate anxiety, depression and stress. The program was based on standard cognitive behavior therapy principles and included 5 core modules, some of which involved options for focusing on anxiety and/or depression and/or stress. Trained student coaches provided encouragement and advice about using the program via e-mail or brief weekly phone calls. Sixty-six distressed university students were randomly assigned to either Immediate Access or a 6-week Delayed Access condition. Sixty-one percent of Immediate Access participants completed all 5 core modules, and 80{\%} of all participants completed the second assessment. On the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21, Immediate Access participants reported significantly greater reductions in depression ({\textperiodcentered}p2= 07), anxiety ({\textperiodcentered}p2= 08) and stress ({\textperiodcentered}p2= 12) in comparison to participants waiting to do the program, and these improvements were maintained at a six month follow-up. The results suggest that the provision of individually-adaptable, internet-based, self-help programs can reduce psychological distress in university students. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to contribute to assertiveness research and assess the differences in assertiveness as it relates to gender, national culture, and ethnicity. Design/methodology/approach – The data for the study are from 231 undergraduate students majoring in business at one of four academic institutions: three in the USA and one in the Republic of Vietnam. Students completed the 30-item Rathus Assertiveness Schedule. Findings – This research suggests that individuals who are alike in level of education and status demonstrate similar levels of assertiveness, regardless of gender, national culture, or ethnicity. However, differences were seen as the data show white American males to be the most assertive, with African American females next. White females ranked third, followed by Vietnamese females, concluding with Vietnamese males. Research limitations/implications – Although the sample size is small, the intent of this research was never to have the subjects represent the general population in terms of the variables used. Instead, the authors attempted to control for gender, culture, and ethnicity variables by using a sample of college students who were similar in relation to education and social status. Future research could more fully research the findings from this study which suggest that African American women are more assertive than all other groups with the exception of white males. Originality/value – This study also gives credence to the suggestion that the global manager, in order to become more effective, needs to fully understand employee differences as represented by gender, national culture, and ethnicity.},

Methods: Evidence regarding the psychometric and pragmatic characteristics of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)-7 anxiety and PHQ-15 somatic symptom scales are synthesized from two sources: (1) four multisite cross-sectional studies (three conducted in primary care and one in obstetric-gynecology practices) comprising 9740 patients, and (2) key studies from the literature that have studied these scales. Results: The PHQ-9 and its abbreviated eight-item (PHQ-8) and two-item (PHQ-2) versions have good sensitivity and specificity for detecting depressive disorders. Likewise, the GAD-7 and its abbreviated two-item (GAD-2) version have good operating characteristics for detecting generalized anxiety, panic, social anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The optimal cutpoint is ≥10 on the parent scales (PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and ≥3 on the ultra-brief versions (PHQ-2 and GAD-2). The PHQ-15 is equal or superior to other brief measures for assessing somatic symptoms and screening for somatoform disorders. Cutpoints of 5, 10 and 15 represent mild, moderate and severe symptom levels on all three scales. Sensitivity to change is well-established for the PHQ-9 and emerging albeit not yet definitive for the GAD-7 and PHQ-15. Conclusions: The PHQ-9, GAD-7 and PHQ-15 are brief well-validated measures for detecting and monitoring depression, anxiety and somatization. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {The current research consisted of 2 studies designed to test the effec-tiveness of automated multiple-exemplar relational training in raising children's general intellectual skills. In Study 1, 4 participants were ex-posed to multiple exemplar training in stimulus equivalence and the relational frames of SAME, OPPOSITE, MORE THAN, and LESS THAN across several sessions and weeks. WISC (III-UK) measures were taken at baseline, following stimulus equivalence training, and again follow-ing relational frame training. Matched against a no-treatment control group, experimental participants showed significant improvements in full-scale IQ following stimulus equivalence training, and a further significant rise following relational frame training. Study 2 adminis-tered an improved multiple-exemplar-based relational frame training intervention to 8 children with a range of educational and behavioral difficulties. In 7 of the 8 cases, full-scale IQ as measured by the WISC (IV-UK) rose by at least 1 SD; the improvement was statistically sig-nificant at the group level. These data have important implications for the behavioral analysis of intellectual skills and suggest the basis of an intervention to improve general cognitive functioning.},

The PEO network was produced by acid-catlayzed self-condensation of $\alpha$,$\omega$-bis(triethoxysilane)-terminated PEO in the presence of small amounts of water. The PMMA network was formed by free radical polymerization of MAA in the presence of divinylbenzene as crosslinker. The reaction conditions were adjusted to obtain similar crosslinking kinetics for both reactions. An attempt was made to construct a phase diagram of the IPNs by measuring the composition of the IPNs at the moment of the appearance of the phase separation, as indicated by the onset of turbidity. This composition could be determined because the siloxane crosslinks of the PEO network could be hydrolyzed in aqueous NaOH with the formation of linear, soluble PEO chains. The phase diagram was compared with phase diagrams of blends of linear polymers and of semi-IPNs (crosslinked PMMA and linear PEO), obtained under similar conditions, i.e. polymerization of MMA in the presence of varying amounts of PEO. It was observed that the form of the phase diagrams of the linear polymers is similar to that of the IPNs, but is quite different from that of the semi-IPNs. Thus, homogeneous transparent materials containing up to 60{\%} of PEO could be prepared in the blends and the IPNs, but in the semi-IPNs, phase separation occurred with PEO contents as low as 10{\%}.},

abstract = {Background and objectives: Traditional models and methods of exposure therapy utilize a fear hierarchy, whereby patients complete sets of exposures in a graduated manner, with the goal of fear habituation within and between sessions. In the current experiment, we examined whether this typical exposure paradigm was necessary to achieve clinical improvement. Method: Fifty undergraduate participants scoring in the top quartile of a self-report measure of contamination fears were randomly assigned to one of two groups: blocked and constant exposure (BC Group) and random and variable exposure (RV Group). Both groups completed three weekly sessions of exposure treatment, with subjective and psychophysiological indices of fear recorded throughout. Subjective, behavioral, and psychophysiological dependent measures were evaluated by an independent assessor at pre-treatment (PRE), post-treatment (POST), and two-week follow-up (2WFU). Results: Both the BC Group and RV Group exhibited decreases in subjective fear from PRE to POST and 2WFU, with no significant differences between groups. Partialing group, greater variability in subjective fear during exposure predicted lower subjective fear at 2WFU. Limitations: Despite significant findings for subjective fear, behavioral and psychophysiological findings were limited. Follow-up studies should investigate questions regarding traditional exposure within a clinical group. Conclusions: These results support the notion that traditional exposure is sufficient, but not necessary, to produce clinical improvement in contamination-related fears. There may be benefits to variability in fear level during exposure, and evaluation of emotion variability during exposure therapy for other anxiety disorders is warranted. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study tested the effects of therapist-guided internet-delivered acceptance-based behaviour therapy on symptoms of GAD and quality of life. An audio CD with acceptance and mindfulness exercises and a separate workbook were also included in the treatment. Participants diagnosed with GAD (N ¼ 103) were randomly allocated to immediate therapist-guided internet-delivered acceptance-based behaviour therapy or to a waiting-list control condition. A six month follow-up was also included. Results using hierarchical linear modelling showed moderate to large effects on symptoms of GAD (Cohen's d ¼ 0.70 to 0.98), moderate effects on depressive symptoms (Cohen's d ¼ 0.51 to 0.56), and no effect on quality of life. Follow-up data showed maintained effects. While there was a 20{\%} dropout rate, sensitivity analyses showed that dropouts did not differ in their degree of change during treatment. To conclude, our study suggests that internet-delivered acceptance-based behaviour therapy can be effective in reducing the symptoms of GAD.},

abstract = {The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDIII) are frequently used measures of depression severity, but little is known about their relative psychometric properties. The authors assessed psychometric properties of both measures during treatment for depression. The PHQ-9 and BDI-II scores from 172 depressed participants in two randomized controlled trials of treatment for depression were assessed and combined. Tests of internal consistency (Cronbach's a), factor analyses, correlational analyses, estimates of clinically significant change, and effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated after treatment and follow-up. Both scales demonstrated adequate internal consistency at pre- and posttreatment (PHQ-9 $\alpha$ = .74 and .81; BDI-II a = .87 and .90, respectively). Factor analysis failed to confirm the one-factor model previously reported for the PHQ-9, but two factors evidenced good fit for the BDI-II. Both scales converged more with each other than with the Sheehan Disability Scale at pre- but not at posttreatment. Responsiveness to change of PHQ-9 and BDI-II was similar at both posttreatment and follow-up. The consistency of agreement on indices of clinical significance was fair to moderate, but the BDI-II categorised a greater proportion of participants with severe depression than the PHQ-9. The BDI-II and PHQ-9 demonstrated adequate reliability, convergent/discriminant validity, and similar responsiveness to change. Differences were found in how they categorised severity. Pending the results of further studies, the attributes of the PHQ-9, of being shorter and based on the diagnostic criteria for depression, may indicate an advantage over the BDI-II. {\textcopyright} 2011 Swedish Association for Behaviour Therapy.},

However, the control groups were often waitlisted, care-as-usual or attention control. Hence, little is known about the relative efficacy of ICBT as compared to face-to-face cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, which included 1418 participants, guided ICBT for psychiatric and somatic conditions were directly compared to face-to-face CBT within the same trial. Out of the 2078 articles screened, a total of 20 studies met all inclusion criteria. Results showed a pooled effect size at post-treatment of Hedges g =.05 (95{\%} CI, −.09 to.20), indicating that ICBT and face-to-face treatment produced equivalent overall effects. Study quality did not affect outcomes. While the overall results indicate equivalence, there have been few studies of the individual psychiatric and somatic conditions so far, and for the majority, guided ICBT has not been compared against face-to-face treatment. Thus, more research, preferably with larger sample sizes, is needed to establish the general equivalence of the two treatment formats.},

abstract = {Assertiveness has for long been considered an optimal way of expressing oneself while at the same time maintaining and/or enhancing social rewards, leading to the conclusion that it should be promoted as an intra and interpersonal protective factor. Yet, few researchers have tried to provide a comprehensive model on assertiveness that may better sustain why and how to train it. We propose a cognitive model for explaining how assertiveness comes to be enacted and maintained, considering the activation of previous individual schemas, how they influence the processing of social cues, which in turn influence the interactive activation of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral assertive products. The assertive behavior in turn prompts reactions from the interaction partner. This interpersonal exchange will serve to confirm previous schemas and make them more accessible when facing future social events. We further review previous findings on several assumptions involved in this model and propose how these findings can sustain cognitive-behavioral approaches to assertive training, building on the premises that the intrapersonal psychological functioning is manifested in interpersonal observed behaviors. Subsequently, new directions for the study and training of assertiveness based on a social information-processing framework are discussed, also considering the current social challenges and contexts that we, as human beings, must face.},

The process starts with the determination of the drivers, which are the foundation for architecture principles. In subsequent subprocesses the architecture principles themselves are determined, specified, classified, validated and applied. The application of architecture principles entails deriving more specific directives from them, as well as transforming them to diagrammatic representations. The next subprocess is using architecture principles to determine whether projects comply with the architecture. Architecture principles are positioned as the primary enablers for an effective architecture governance.

Method: Participants (n = 36) completed the Helpful and Hindering Aspects of Therapy (HAT) for each session. A descriptive-interpretative framework was used to analyse the data. Results: Helpful events were identified by participants as CBT techniques including psychoeducation, monitoring, cognitive restructuring and relaxation, and found supporter interaction, mindfulness and reading personal stories helpful. The associated impacts were identified as support and validation; behavioural change/applying coping strategies; clarification, awareness, and insight; reassurance/relief; and self-efficacy/empowerment. Hindering events were identified as treatment content/form; and amount of work/technical issues, which led to impacts such as frustration/irritation; increased anxiety; and isolation. Conclusion: The implications of the results, potential future directions of research and limitations of the study are discussed.},

abstract = {Although several self-report inventories of assertive behaviors are available for clinical and research use, normative data currently available on these measures provide only a gross index with regard to an individual's assertiveness relative to others in his social milieu. A study was conducted to develop more specific normative data for the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule (RAS). The RAS was administered to 133 undergraduates, and percentile norms were developed from the obtained distribution of total scores. In addition, derived scores were calculated from Z score norms developed for each item. The percentile norms provide information on an individual's overall assertiveness relative to others in his social milieu, while the item norms provide information as to relative assertiveness in specific target situations. It is suggested that the percentile norms might prove most useful in research with groups for which only a gross index of relative assertiveness is required. Normative data for the items of the RAS should be clinically useful, not only to pinpoint areas of deficit assertive behavior, but also to assess behavior change after therapeutic intervention. The need for additional research is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of iCBT compared to inactive (waitlist control and treatment-as-usual (TAU)) and active other interventions in reducing PTSD symptoms. Methods: A meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials (14 comparisons) and 1,306 participants was conducted. Results: The pooled effect size of the 11 comparisons (10 studies, 1,139 participants) that compared iCBT to waitlist and TAU control was moderate (g = 0.71, 95{\%} CI [0.49–0.93], P {\textless}.001), and showed moderate heterogeneity. The pooled effect size of the three studies (three comparisons) comparing iCBT to other interventions was small (g = 0.28, 95{\%} CI [−0.00 to 0.56], P =.05), with low heterogeneity. Conclusion: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis show that iCBT is an effective treatment for individuals with PTSD and comorbid depressive symptoms. However, further research is needed for effective dissemination of iCBT in clinical practice.},

A substantial body of research indicates that assertiveness is a relevant factor associated with a variety of clinical problems, populations and contexts, and that assertiveness training is a valuable transdiagnostic intervention. Despite its demonstrated importance, research on assertiveness and assertiveness training as a stand-alone treatment within clinical psychology has diminished drastically. We review the history of assertiveness training, early research evidence for assertiveness training in treating various clinical problems, discuss the current status of assertiveness training, issues of clinical implementation, and comment on how the variables accounting for unassertiveness map onto the NIMH RDoC funding priorities.},

abstract = {Background: Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (wCBT) has been proposed as a possible treatment for patients with heart failure and depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms are common in patients with heart failure and such symptoms are known to significantly worsen their health. Although there are promising results on the effect of wCBT, there is a knowledge gap regarding how persons with chronic heart failure and depressive symptoms experience wCBT. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore and describe the experiences of participating and receiving health care through a wCBT intervention among persons with heart failure and depressive symptoms. Methods: In this qualitative, inductive, exploratory, and descriptive study, participants with experiences of a wCBT program were interviewed. The participants were included through purposeful sampling among participants previously included in a quantitative study on wCBT. Overall, 13 participants consented to take part in this study and were interviewed via telephone using an interview guide. Verbatim transcripts from the interviews were qualitatively analyzed following the recommendations discussed by Patton in Qualitative Research {\&} Evaluation Methods: Integrating Theory and Practice. After coding each interview, codes were formed into categories. Results: Overall, six categories were identified during the analysis process. They were as follows: “Something other than usual health care,” “Relevance and recognition,” “Flexible, understandable, and safe,” “Technical problems,” “Improvements by real-time contact,” and “Managing my life better.” One central and common pattern in the findings was that participants experienced the wCBT program as something they did themselves and many participants described the program as a form of self-care. Conclusions: Persons with heart failure and depressive symptoms described wCBT as challenging. This was due to participants balancing the urge for real-time contact with perceived anonymity and not postponing the work with the program. wCBT appears to be a valuable tool for managing depressive symptoms.},

A systematic database search was conducted of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and Cochrane for relevant studies published from 1990 to September 2018. A study was included if the following criteria were met: (1) randomized controlled trial involving an ICBT intervention; (2) participants experienced a chronic health condition; (3) participants ≥ 18 years of age; and (4) effects of ICBT on anxiety and/or depression were reported. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias on the included studies. Pooled analysis was conducted on the primary and condition specific secondary outcomes. Twenty-five studies met inclusion criteria and investigated the following chronic health conditions: tinnitus (n = 6), fibromyalgia (n = 3), pain (n = 7), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 3), cardiovascular disease (n = 2), diabetes (n = 1), cancer (n = 1), heterogeneous chronic disease population (n = 1), and spinal cord injury (n = 1). Pooled analysis demonstrated small effects of ICBT in improving anxiety and depression. Moderate effects of therapist-guided approach were seen for depression and anxiety outcomes; while, self-guided approaches resulted in small effects for depression and moderate effects in anxiety outcomes. ICBT shows promise as an alternative to traditional face-to-face interventions among persons with chronic health conditions. Future research on long-term effects of ICBT for individuals with chronic health conditions is needed. Trial Registration PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018087292.},

In total, 156 individuals were included and randomized to an eight-week treatment or wait-list control. Self-report measures of perfectionism, depression, anxiety, self-criticism, self-compassion, and quality of life were distributed during screening and at post-treatment. Intention-to-treat were used for all statistical analyses. Moderate to large between-group effect sizes were obtained for the primary outcome measures, Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, subscales Concerns over Mistakes and Personal Standards, Cohen's d = 0.68–1.00, 95{\%} Confidence Interval (CI) [0.36–1.33], with 35 (44.9{\%}) of the patients in treatment being improved. Predictors were also explored, but none were related to treatment outcome. In sum, guided ICBT can be helpful for addressing problems with clinical perfectionism, but research of its long-term benefits is warranted.},

abstract = {Background: The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) is a practical self-report anxiety questionnaire that proved valid in primary care. However, the GAD-7 was not yet validated in the general population and thus far, normative data are not available. Objectives: To investigate reliability, construct validity, and facto-rial validity of the GAD-7 in the general population and to generate normative data. Research Design: Nationally representative face-to-face household survey conducted in Germany between May 5 and June 8, 2006. Subjects: Five thousand thirty subjects (53.6{\%} female) with a mean age (SD) of 48.4 (18.0) years. Measures: The survey questionnaire included the GAD-7, the 2-item depression module from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and demographic char-acteristics. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses substantiated the 1-dimen-sional structure of the GAD-7 and its factorial invariance for gender and age. Internal consistency was identical across all subgroups (␣ ϭ 0.89). Intercorrelations with the PHQ-2 and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale were r ϭ 0.64 (P Ͻ 0.001) and r ϭ Ϫ0.43 (P Ͻ 0.001), respectively. As expected, women had significantly higher mean (SD) GAD-7 anxiety scores compared with men ͓3.2 (3.5) vs. 2.7 (3.2); P Ͻ 0.001͔. Normative data for the GAD-7 were generated for both genders and different age levels. Approximately 5{\%} of subjects had GAD-7 scores of 10 or greater, and 1{\%} had GAD-7 scores of 15 or greater. Conclusions: Evidence supports reliability and validity of the GAD-7 as a measure of anxiety in the general population. The normative data provided in this study can be used to compare a subject's GAD-7 score with those determined from a general pop-ulation reference group.},

In particular, therapist-guided Internet treatments have been found to be effective for a wide range of psychiatric and somatic conditions in well over 100 controlled trials. These treatments require (a) a secure web platform, (b) robust assessment procedures, (c) treatment contents that can be text based or offered in other formats, and (d) a therapist role that differs from that in face-to-face therapy. Studies suggest that guided Internet treatments can be as effective as face-to-face treatments, lead to sustained improvements, work in clinically representative conditions, and probably are cost-effective. Despite these research findings, Internet treatment is not yet disseminated in most places, and clinical psychologists should consider using modern information technology and evidence-based treatment programs as a complement to their other services, even though there will always be clients for whom face-to-face treatment is the best option.},

Although many assertiveness instruments have been developed for research and clinical purposes, one common shortcoming is a lack of discriminant validity with regard to aggression.

The goal of the present research was to develop a more sensitive instrument measuring two distinguishable forms of assertiveness: adaptive assertiveness and aggressive assertiveness. We present data validating such a measure, the Adaptive and Aggressive Assertiveness Scales (AAA-S). Participants included two samples of college students and a clinical sample of adults with anxiety disorders. The AAA-S demonstrated good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The aggressive assertiveness scale was associated with various forms of aggression and peer reports of aggressive assertiveness. The adaptive assertiveness scale was associated with competence and peer reports of adaptive assertiveness. Importantly, there were no gender differences in adaptive assertiveness.

Research suggests they are domain-specific, meaning that individuals can hold a fixed (immutability) mind-set about one attribute and a growth (malleability) mind-set about another. Although mind-set specificity has been investigated for broad attributes such as personality and intelligence, less is known about mental health mind-sets (e.g., beliefs about anxiety) that have greater relevance to clinical science. In two studies, we took a latent variable approach to examine how different mind-sets (anxiety, social anxiety, depression, drinking tendencies, emotions, intelligence, and personality mind-sets) were related to one another and to psychological symptoms. Results provide evidence for both domain specificity (e.g., depression mind-set predicted depression symptoms) and generality (i.e., the anxiety mind-set and the general mind-set factor predicted most symptoms). These findings may help refine measurement of mental health mind-sets and suggest that beliefs about anxiety and beliefs about changeability in general are related to clinically relevant variables.},

Reliability figures were very encouraging. The majority of the 10 SIB dimensions showed no meaningful sex differences that had important practical, normative implications. However, future normative studies with the SIB in North America should take into account the fact that female students are more assertive (i.e. show less behavioral avoidance) than their male counterparts when expressing and dealing with personal limitations, whereas male students are more assertive (i.e. experience less distress) than female students when displaying negative assertion. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

Compared to waitlist (n ¼ 29; 58{\%} female), CBT (n ¼ 24; 52{\%} female) led to significantly lower levels of fixed beliefs about anxiety (M baseline ¼ 11.70 vs. M Post ¼ 7.08, d ¼ 1.27). These implicit beliefs indirectly explained CBT-related changes in social anxiety symptoms (k 2 ¼ .28, [95{\%} CI ¼ 0.12, 0.46]). Implicit beliefs also uniquely predicted treatment outcomes when controlling for baseline social anxiety and other kinds of maladaptive beliefs (perceived social costs, perceived social self-efficacy, and maladaptive interpersonal beliefs). Finally, implicit beliefs continued to predict social anxiety symptoms at 12 months post-treatment. These findings suggest that changes in patients' beliefs about their emotions may play an important role in CBT for SAD.},

A sample of 972 first-year college students between 17 and 20 years of age completed self-report measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress as well as a structured diagnostic interview. Psychological inflexibility was significantly higher across a range of current and lifetime depressive and anxiety disorders as well as lifetime history of eating disorders, relative to students with no disorder, even after controlling for general psychological distress. Findings were mixed for substance use disorders, with a more consistent pattern for lifetime history than for current disorders. Psychological inflexibility was also related to having comorbid depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders relative to only having one of these diagnoses. Results are discussed in relation to research on psychological inflexibility as a transdiagnostic pathological process and target for interventions.},

abstract = {Background: The current study explored whether higher- (up to 8 modules) versus lower-dose (3 or less modules) unguided internet Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for perfectionism (ICBT-P) was more effective, and the best method to promote higher dosage. Methods: Two sequential randomised ICBT-P studies were conducted with participants who self-identified as having difficulties with perfectionism; in the first participants (N = 51) received 3-module ICBT-P or wait-list, and in the second participants (N = 55) received fixed (asked to complete all 8 modules two per week over 4-weeks) or flexible format (after completing the first psychoeducational module, participants decided how many/in what order they completed the modules). We examined impact on our primary variables, perfectionistic concerns and standards, and secondary outcomes of negative affect, body image flexibility, and self-efficacy. Results: More modules were completed in the higher- (M modules = 4.36, SD = 3.29) versus lower-dose (M = 1.96, SD = 1.23) ICBT-P, d = 0.86 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.39, 1.34). The latter impacted perfectionism but not secondary outcomes; the former impacted all outcomes (except for self-efficacy), and within-group effect size improvements were double in the high- compared to low-dose ICBT-P. There was no difference between the fixed and flexible formats in terms of the number of modules completed or impact. Conclusions: We can offer a patient-centred approach to ICBT-P that is effective, while suggesting completion of more modules can result in larger, more pervasive improvements.

abstract = {Learning theory provides a foundation for understanding and deriving treatment principles for impacting a spectrum of functional processes relevant to the construct of depression. While behavioral interventions have been commonplace in the cognitive behavioral tradition, most often conceptualized within a cognitive theoretical framework, recent years have seen renewed interest in more purely behavioral models. These modern learning theory accounts of depression focus on the interchange between behavior and the environment, mainly in terms of lack of reinforcement, extinction of instrumental behavior, and excesses of aversive control, and include a conceptualization of relevant cognitive and emotional variables. These positions, drawn from extensive basic and applied research, cohere with biological theories on reduced reward learning and reward responsiveness and views of depression as a heterogeneous, complex set of disorders. Treatment techniques based on learning theory, often labeled Behavioral Activation (BA) focus on activating the individual in directions that increase contact with potential reinforcers, as defined ideographically with the client. BA is considered an empirically well-established treatment that generalizes well across diverse contexts and populations. The learning theory account is discussed in terms of being a parsimonious model and ground for treatments highly suitable for large scale dissemination.},

abstract = {Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) refers to a popular therapeutic approach that has been applied to a variety of problems. The goal of this review was to provide a comprehensive survey of meta-analyses examining the efficacy of CBT. We identified 269 meta-analytic studies and reviewed of those a representative sample of 106 metaanalyses examining CBT for the following problems: substance use disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, depression and dysthymia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, eating disorders, insomnia, personality disorders, anger and aggression, criminal behaviors, general stress, distress due to general medical conditions, chronic pain and fatigue, distress related to pregnancy complications and female hormonal conditions. Additional meta-analytic reviews examined the efficacy of CBT for various problems in children and elderly adults. The strongest support exists for CBT of anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, bulimia, anger control problems, and general stress. Eleven studies compared response rates between CBT and other treatments or control conditions. CBT showed higher response rates than the comparison conditions in seven of these reviews and only one review reported that CBT had lower response rates than comparison treatments. In general, the evidencebase of CBT is very strong. However, additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of CBT for randomizedcontrolled studies. Moreover, except for children and elderly populations, no meta-analytic studies of CBT have been reported on specific subgroups, such as ethnic minorities and low income samples. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

abstract = {Objective: Our aim in this randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effects on global tinnitus severity of 2 Internet-delivered psychological treatments, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), in guided self-help format. Method: Ninety-nine participants (mean age = 48.5 years; 43{\%} female) who were significantly distressed by tinnitus were recruited from the community. Participants were randomly assigned to CBT (n = 32), ACT (n = 35), or a control condition (monitored Internet discussion forum; n = 32), and they were assessed with standardized self-report measures (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Quality of Life Inventory; Perceived Stress Scale; Tinnitus Acceptance Questionnaire) at pre-, posttreatment (8 weeks), and 1-year follow-up. Results: Mixed-effects linear regression analysis of all randomized participants showed significant effects on the primary outcome (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory) for CBT and for ACT compared with control at posttreatment (95{\%} CI [-17.03,-2.94], d = 0.70, and 95{\%} CI [-16.29,-2.53], d = 0.68, respectively). Within-group effects were substantial from pretreatment through 1-year-follow-up for both treatments (95{\%} CI [-44.65,-20.45], d = 1.34), with no significant difference between treatments (95{\%} CI [-14.87, 11.21], d = 0.16).

abstract = {In this target article, we present evidence for a new model of individual differences in judgments and reactions. The model holds that people's implicit theories about human attributes structure the way they understand and react to human actions and outcomes. We review research showing that when people believe that attributes (such as intelligence or moral character) are fixed, trait-like entities (an entity theory), they tend to understand outcomes and actions in terms of these fixed traits (“I failed the test because I am dumb” or “He stole the bread because he is dishonest”). In contrast, when people believe that attributes are more dynamic, malleable, and developable (an incremental theory), they tend to focus less on broad traits and, instead, tend to understand outcomes and actions in terms of more specific behavioral or psychological mediators (“I failed the test because of my effort or strategy” or “He stole the bread because he was desperate”). The two frameworks also appear to foster different reactions: helpless versus mastery-oriented responses to personal setbacks and an emphasis on retribution versus education or rehabilitation for transgressions. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for personality, motivation, and social perception. {\textcopyright} 1995, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract = { Background. The clinician-administered version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS-CA) is a commonly used assessment device for the evaluation of social anxiety disorder and has been shown to have strong psychometric characteristics. Because of its apparently straightforward rating format and potential savings in time and effort, interest in the use of the LSAS as a self-report (LSAS-SR) measure has increased, and the LSAS-SR has been used in a number of studies. However, the psychometric properties of the LSAS-SR have not been well established.  Methods. This study examined the psychometric properties of the LSAS-SR in comparison to the LSAS-CA in a sample of 99 individuals with a primary diagnosis of social anxiety disorder and 53 individuals with no current psychiatric disorder.  Results. There was little difference between the two versions of the LSAS on any scale or subscale score. Both forms were internally consistent and the subscale intercorrelations for the two forms were essentially identical. Correlations of each LSAS-SR index with its LSAS-CA counterpart were all highly significant. Finally, the convergent and discriminant validity of the two forms of the LSAS was shown to be strong.  Conclusion. Results of this study suggest that the self-report version of the LSAS compares well to the clinician-administered version and may be validly employed in the assessment of social anxiety disorder. },

Examples abound in experimental psychology and include abstraction and concept learning, responding to relations, identity matching, rule following, behavioral variability, responding to wh-questions, describing past events, learning sets, and continuous repertoires. Thus, behavior analysts often allude to a history of multiple exemplar training to account for different generalized performances. It is easy to see how a strategy of multiple exemplar training can work with many types of performances, even performances that involve relations between objects or events. However, there appear to be at least two exceptions, where direct multiple exemplar training does not work well: (1) when there are no physical dimensions at all along which generalized performances can emerge, and (2) when the relation between a stimulus and an effective response is complex. Interpretation of the latter type of cases in terms of mediated generalization is outlined and discussed. An experimental and conceptual research program should produce an account of the general limits of multiple exemplar training, and guidelines for the most effective training for generalized skills.},

Those who believe their attributes are fixed view setbacks as threatening and avoid challenging situations. In contrast, those who believe these attributes are malleable embrace challenges as opportunities to grow. Although implicit theories would seem to have important mental health implications, the research linking them with clinical applications is limited. To address this gap, we assessed how implicit theories of anxiety, emotion, intelligence, and personality related to various symptoms of anxiety and depression, emotion-regulation strategies, and hypothetical treatment choices (e.g., medication versus therapy) in two undergraduate samples. Across both samples, individuals who believed their attributes could change reported fewer mental health symptoms, greater use of cognitive reappraisal, and were more likely to choose individual therapy over medication. These findings suggest that implicit theories may play an important role in the nature and treatment of mental health problems.},

Compared to controls, both social phobics and patients with an avoidant personality disorder had significantly lower mean scores on all performance scales and significantly higher ones on all distress scales, with the social phobics occupying a position in between. Findings in relation to convergent and divergent validity were quite satisfactory.

abstract = {The first wave of behavior therapy countered the excesses and scientific weakness of existing nonempirical clinical traditions through empirically studied first-order change efforts linked to behavioral principles targeting directly relevant clinical tar-gets. The second wave was characterized by similar direct change efforts guided by social learning and cognitive principles that included cognitive in addition to behav-ioral and emotive targets. Various factors seem to have set the stage for a third wave, including anomalies in the current literature and philosophical changes. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is one of a number of new interventions from both behavioral and cognitive wings that seem to be moving the field in a different direc-tion. ACT is explicitly contextualistic and is based on a basic experimental analysis of human language and cognition, Relational Frame Theory (RFF). RFT explains why cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance are both ubiquitous and harmful. ACT targets these processes and is producing supportive data both at the process and outcome level. The third-wave treatments are characterized by openness to older clinical traditions, a focus on second order and contextual change, an emphasis of function over form, and the construction of flexible and effective repertoires, among other features. They build on the first-and second-wave treatments, but seem to be carrying the behavior therapy tradition forward into new territory. Over the last several years quite a number of behavior therapies have emerged that do not fit easily into traditional categories within the field.},

Objective: Review evidence that computerized CBT for the anxiety and depressive disorders is acceptable to patients and effective in the short and longer term. Method: Systematic reviews and data bases were searched for randomized controlled trials of computerized cognitive behavior therapy versus a treatment or control condition in people who met diagnostic criteria for major depression, panic disorder, social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder. Number randomized, superiority of treatment versus control (Hedges g) on primary outcome measure, risk of bias, length of follow up, patient adherence and satisfaction were extracted. Principal Findings: 22 studies of comparisons with a control group were identified. The mean effect size superiority was 0.88 (NNT 2.13), and the benefit was evident across all four disorders. Improvement from computerized CBT was maintained for a median of 26 weeks follow-up. Acceptability, as indicated by adherence and satisfaction, was good. Research probity was good and bias risk low. Effect sizes were non-significantly higher in comparisons with waitlist than with active treatment control conditions. Five studies comparing computerized CBT with traditional face-to-face CBT were identified, and both modes of treatment appeared equally beneficial. Conclusions: Computerized CBT for anxiety and depressive disorders, especially via the internet, has the capacity to provide effective acceptable and practical health care for those who might otherwise remain untreated. {\textcopyright} 2010 Andrews et al.},

abstract = {Individuals avoid stimuli which are associated with aversive experience to preserve safety. However, behavioral avoidance also causes impairments and prevents the individual from attaining positive rewards. Little is known about the link between fear acquisition and the development of behavioral avoidance in the presence of potential rewards. Therefore, two experiments investigated the impact of fear conditioning on a subsequent gambling task. In an experimental group (n = 30) advantageous choices (higher reward probability) were linked to a fear-relevant stimulus that was associated with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) during fear conditioning (conditioned stimulus, CS+). A disadvantageous choice (lower reward probability) was, however, linked to a safe stimulus that was never associated with the US (CS-). In a control group (n = 25), fear conditioning was followed by a similar gambling task with novel stimuli. A second experiment focused on individual predictors of avoidant decisions (n = 81). Compared with the control group, individuals in the experimental groups avoided the advantageous CS + choice despite fewer gains. The predictor analysis further clarified that avoidant decisions were pronounced in highly trait anxious participants who exhibited higher fear responses. On the other hand, findings also indicated a reduction in absolute avoidance across the task. Combined, these findings demonstrate that fear conditioning can lead to avoidant decision making, especially in vulnerable individuals. The resulting costs parallel impairments caused by behavioral avoidance. Such an emotional decision-making style may be a link between aversive experience and the development of habitual pathological avoidance. Introducing rewards for approach, however, may counteract avoidant decisions.},

abstract = {Introduction: The aim of this study was to systematically review the impact of guidance on the efficacy of Internet-based interventions. Methods: Included were RCTs with a comparison of (1) guided vs. unguided interventions, (2) different doses of guidance, (3) different qualification levels of e-coaches, and (4) synchronous vs. asynchronous communication mode. Outcomes were symptom severity, completer rates and number of completed intervention modules. A systematic search of MEDLINE, CENTRAL and PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and Psyndex (search date 4th June 2013) was conducted, as well as a hand search of trial-registers and the reference lists of included articles. Methodological quality was rated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Relevant study characteristics and outcome data were extracted. Random-effects analyses were conducted if appropriate. Results: 5328 articles were retrieved of which 14 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Guided interventions were significantly superior to unguided interventions ((symptom severity: standardized mean difference (. SMD). =. -. .27 [. 95{\%} CI: -. .45; -. .10]), n. =. 8; completed modules: SMD=. .52 [.37; .67], n. =. 7; completer rate: OR=. 2.76 [1.68; 4.53], n. =. 6). The four trials that examined different levels of e-coach qualification showed no significant differences on either of the outcome measures. Only one trial each examined the remaining two research questions, without significant effects on either of the outcome measures. Conclusions: Guidance is a beneficial feature of Internet-based interventions, although its effect is smaller than reported before when compared to unguided interventions. The qualification of the e-coaches seems of minor importance. However, methodological limitations need to be considered when interpreting these findings. Overall, the number of studies was small and mainly limited to depression and social phobia restricting the generalizability of the findings.},

abstract = {The present study investigated perceived acceptability and suppression of negative emotion in participants with anxiety and mood disorders. Sixty participants with these disorders and 30 control participants watched an emotion-provoking film and completed self-report measures of their experience and regulation of emotions. The film elicited similar increases in negative emotion for clinical and nonclinical participants; however, clinical participants judged their resulting emotions as less acceptable and suppressed their emotions to a greater extent. The higher level of suppression in the clinical group was attributable to females in the clinical group suppressing their emotions more than females in the nonclinical group. For all participants, high levels of suppression were associated with increased negative emotion during the film and during a postfilm recovery period. Further analyses showed that appraising emotions as unacceptable mediated the relationship between negative emotion intensity and use of suppression in the clinical group. This study extends the literature on emotion regulation to a clinical sample and suggests that judging emotions as unacceptable and suppressing emotions may be important aspects of the phenomenology of emotional disorders.},

abstract = {Background and objectives: Traditional models and methods of exposure therapy utilize a fear hierarchy, whereby patients complete sets of exposures in a graduated manner, with the goal of fear habituation within and between sessions. In the current experiment, we examined whether this typical exposure paradigm was necessary to achieve clinical improvement. Method: Fifty undergraduate participants scoring in the top quartile of a self-report measure of contamination fears were randomly assigned to one of two groups: blocked and constant exposure (BC Group) and random and variable exposure (RV Group). Both groups completed three weekly sessions of exposure treatment, with subjective and psychophysiological indices of fear recorded throughout. Subjective, behavioral, and psychophysiological dependent measures were evaluated by an independent assessor at pre-treatment (PRE), post-treatment (POST), and two-week follow-up (2WFU). Results: Both the BC Group and RV Group exhibited decreases in subjective fear from PRE to POST and 2WFU, with no significant differences between groups. Partialing group, greater variability in subjective fear during exposure predicted lower subjective fear at 2WFU. Limitations: Despite significant findings for subjective fear, behavioral and psychophysiological findings were limited. Follow-up studies should investigate questions regarding traditional exposure within a clinical group. Conclusions: These results support the notion that traditional exposure is sufficient, but not necessary, to produce clinical improvement in contamination-related fears. There may be benefits to variability in fear level during exposure, and evaluation of emotion variability during exposure therapy for other anxiety disorders is warranted. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Separate dimensions were needed to account for the structure of the assertiveness questionnaire across the Mexican and Spanish samples.

abstract = {Aim. This paper reviews the key research literature regarding men's health-related help seeking behaviour. Background. There is a growing body of research in the United States to suggest that men are less likely than women to seek help from health professionals for problems as diverse as depression, substance abuse, physical disabilities and stressful life events. Previous research has revealed that the principle health related issue facing men in the UK is their reluctance to seek access to health services. Method. The investigation of men's health-related help seeking behaviour has great potential for improving both men and women's lives and reducing national health costs through the development of responsive and effective interventions. A search of the literature was conducted using CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Library databases. Results. Studies comparing men and women are inadequate in explaining the processes involved in men's help seeking behaviour. However, the growing body of gender-specific studies highlights a trend of delayed help seeking when they become ill. A prominent theme among white middle class men implicates 'traditional masculine behaviour' as an explanation for delays in seeking help among men who experience illness. The reasons and processes behind this issue, however, have received limited attention. Conclusions. Principally, the role of masculine beliefs and the similarities and differences between men of differing background requires further attention, particularly given the health inequalities that exist between men of differing socio-economic status and ethnicity. Further research using heterogeneous samples is required in order to gain a greater understanding of the triggers and barriers associated with the decision making process of help seeking behaviour in men who experience illness. {\textcopyright} 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Research consistently implicates safety behaviors in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders; accordingly, safety behaviors are traditionally eliminated during exposure treatments for pathological anxiety. The notion that safety behaviors are ubiquitously deleterious in the context of exposure has recently been challenged, yet findings regarding safety behaviors' effects on exposure outcomes are limited, mixed, and controversial. Furthermore, developments in explanatory models for exposure's effectiveness (e.g., inhibitory learning theory) highlight other possible consequences of safety behaviors performed during exposure. Unfortunately, these theoretical advances are neglected in experimental research. The present review critically examines the literature addressing the role of safety behaviors in exposure therapy from an inhibitory learning perspective. Limitations, future directions, and clinical recommendations are also discussed.},

It is evident from my paper that I have refuted their claims regarding each of these parts. Regarding a) Selection of studies I showed that only four studies had a cell size of less than 10 and their inclusion did not change the mean effect size or increased variability. Concerning b) Ratings of methodological quality I have showed that my ratings were reliable and had accuracy. As for c) Meta-analysis, I have demonstrated that I got very similar results to those of A-Tjak et al. (2015) that Atkins et al. describes as a much better meta-analysis.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {\textgreater} or =10 had a sensitivity of 88{\%} and a specificity of 88{\%} for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

abstract = {The present article presents and reviews the model of psychopathology and treatment underlying Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). ACT is unusual in that it is linked to a comprehensive active basic research program on the nature of human language and cognition (Relational Frame Theory), echoing back to an earlier era of behavior therapy in which clinical treatments were consciously based on basic behavioral principles. The evidence from correlational, component, process of change, and outcome comparisons relevant to the model are broadly supportive, but the literature is not mature and many questions have not yet been examined. What evidence is available suggests that ACT works through different processes than active treatment comparisons, including traditional Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT). There are not enough well-controlled studies to conclude that ACT is generally more effective than other active treatments across the range of problems examined, but so far the data are promising.},

abstract = {Internet-based psychotherapeutic interventions have been used for more than a decade, but no comprehensive review and no extensive meta-analysis of their effectiveness have been conducted. We have collected all of the empirical articles published up to March 2006 (n=64) that examine the effectiveness of online therapy of different forms and performed a meta-analysis of all the studies reported in them (n=92). These studies involved a total of 9,764 clients who were treated through various Internet-based psychological interventions for a variety of problems, whose effectiveness was assessed by different types of measures. The overall mean weighted effect size was found to be 0.53 (medium effect), which is quite similar to the average effect size of traditional, face-to-face therapy. Next, we examined interacting effects of various possible relevant moderators of the effects of online therapy, including type of therapy (self-help web-based therapy versus online communication-based etherapy), type of outcome measure, time of measurement of outcome (post-therapy or follow-up), type of problem treated, therapeutic approach, and communication modality, among others. A comparison between face-to-face and Internet intervention as reported on in 14 of the studies revealed no differences in effectiveness. The findings of this meta-analysis, and review of additional Internet therapy studies not included in the meta-analysis, provide strong support for the adoption of online psychological interventions as a legitimate therapeutic activity and suggest several insights in regard to its application. Limitations of the findings and recommendations concerning Internet-based therapy and future research are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The Haworth Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {During the last two decades a number of therapies, under the name of the third wave of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), have been developed: acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP), functional analytic psychotherapy (FAP), and integrative behavioral couple therapy (IBCT). The purposes of this review article of third wave treatment RCTs were: (1) to describe and review them methodologically, (2) to meta-analytically assess their efficacy, and (3) to evaluate if they currently fulfil the criteria for empirically supported treatments. There are 13 RCTs both in ACT and DBT, 1 in CBASP, 2 in IBCT, and none in FAP. The conclusions that can be drawn are that the third wave treatment RCTs used a research methodology that was significantly less stringent than CBT studies; that the mean effect size was moderate for both ACT and DBT, and that none of the third wave therapies fulfilled the criteria for empirically supported treatments. The article ends with suggestions on how to improve future RCTs to increase the possibility of them becoming empirically supported treatments.},

abstract = {When people encounter problems in translating their goals into action (e.g., failing to get started, becoming distracted, or falling into bad habits), they may strategically call on automatic processes in an attempt to secure goal attainment. This can be achieved by plans in the form of implementation intentions that link anticipated critical situations to goal-directed responses ("Whenever situation x arises, I will initiate the goal-directed response y!"). Implementation intentions delegate the control of goal-directed responses to anticipated situational cues, which (when actually encountered) elicit these responses automatically. A program of research demonstrates that implementation intentions further the attainment of goals, and it reveals the underlying processes.

abstract = {Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown efficacious, but the challenge remains to make it available and accessible in order to meet population needs. Delivering CBT-I over the internet (eCBT-I) may be one method to overcome this challenge. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of eCBT-I and the moderating influence of various study characteristics. Two researchers independently searched key electronic databases (1991 to June 2015), selected eligible publications, extracted data, and evaluated methodological quality. Eleven randomized controlled trials examining a total of 1460 participants were included. Results showed that eCBT-I improved insomnia severity, sleep efficiency, subjective sleep quality, wake after sleep onset, sleep onset latency, total sleep time, and number of nocturnal awakenings at post-treatment, with effect sizes (Hedges's g) ranging from 0.21 to 1.09. The effects were comparable to those found for face-to-face CBT-I, and were generally maintained at 4-48 wk follow-up. Moderator analyses showed that longer treatment duration and higher degree of personal clinical support were associated with larger effect sizes, and that larger study dropout in the intervention group was associated with smaller effect sizes. In conclusion, internet-delivered CBT-I appears efficacious and can be considered a viable option in the treatment of insomnia.},

Functional assertiveness is a new concept of assertiveness that represents a method of appropriate self-expression. Functional assertiveness is defined as interpersonal communication that occurs when a speaker encounters interpersonal problems that should be resolved or has objectives that should be achieved, and the speaker's message is perceived as appropriate by the listener (Mitamura {\&} Tanaka-Matsumi, 2010, 2010c). Five studies were conducted in order to develop the FAS. In Study 1, we generated an item pool for FAS, and in Study 2 we developed the FAS prototype using this item pool. Study 3 examined the factorial validity, concurrent validity, and internal consistency of the FAS. Study 4 examined test–retest reliability of the FAS. Study 5 examined responsiveness on the FAS. The validity and reliability of the FAS and potential utility and clinical implication of the FAS are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

abstract = {This work begins by proposing the need for exploring the mode of being of mental disorders. It is a philosophical study in an Aristotelian perspective, with special emphasis on the anthropological–cultural dimension. It is difficult for such an inquiry to be car- ried out from within psychiatry or clinical psychology, committed as these fields are to their own logic and practical conditions. The issues are, in any case, more ontological than strictly clinical in nature. We there- fore turn to Aristotle, and specifically his doctrine of the four “causes,” to flesh out the social and cultural dimensions of mental disorders. In accordance with the present analysis, the material cause of disorders would be found in the contingencies of life; the formal cause would pertain primarily to the way clinical conditions themselves can serve as models of ‘being ill' in our society; the efficient cause would correspond to the pa- tients themselves, understood as active (albeit less than fully conscious) agents as well as to the pharmaceutical industry and the mass media; the final cause would be found in different adaptive functions served by the dis- order. We conclude that the “mode of being” of most (if not all) mental disorders—in particular, their status as mental disorders—can often have more to do with cultural forms than with biological factors.},

abstract = {Anxiety disorders (separation anxiety disorder, selective mutism, specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and generalised anxiety disorder) are common and disabling conditions that mostly begin during childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. They differ from developmentally normative or stress-induced transient anxiety by being marked (ie, out of proportion to the actual threat present) and persistent, and by impairing daily functioning. Most anxiety disorders affect almost twice as many women as men. They often co-occur with major depression, alcohol and other substance-use disorders, and personality disorders. Differential diagnosis from physical conditions—including thyroid, cardiac, and respiratory disorders, and substance intoxication and withdrawal—is imperative. If untreated, anxiety disorders tend to recur chronically. Psychological treatments, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy, and pharmacological treatments, particularly selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and serotonin–noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitors, are effective, and their combination could be more effective than is treatment with either individually. More research is needed to increase access to and to develop personalised treatments.},

To the extent that a scientist embraces both of these as a unified and generally applicable criterion for science, certain philosophical and theoretical practices are counterproductive, including mentalism in both its metaphysical and metatheoretical forms. It is possible and often worthwhile to recast some mentalistic talk into an issue of behavior-behavior relations. When behavior-behavior relations are approached non-mechanistically, however, analysis cannot stop at the level of the relations themselves. Several analytic concepts common in the behavioral community share some of the dangers of mentalism if not employed properly, including such concepts as self-reinforcement, response-produced stimulation, and self-rules.},

Assessments took place at pre-intervention, mid-intervention (mediators), post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up. Mixed effects modeling including all available data from all time points were used for the data analysis. Intervention effects on the reduction of binge rate were weaker for participants with higher baseline BMI and for participants with a lower baseline purge rate. Intervention effects on reduction of eating disorder pathology were weaker for participants with higher baseline purge rate and with initial restrictive eating. No moderators of the intervention effect on restrictive eating were identified. An increase in knowledge mediated the beneficial effect of SB+ on binge rate. The results suggest that different moderators should be considered for the reduction of symptoms and change in attitudes of disturbed eating and that SB+ at least partially operates through psychoeducation.},

abstract = {The current article discusses assertiveness training, a once highly popular area of investigation that has been neglected in recent years by the field of psychotherapy. A substantial body of research indicates that assertiveness is a relevant factor associated with a variety of clinical problems, populations, and contexts, and that assertiveness training is a valuable transdiagnostic intervention. Despite its demonstrated importance, research on assertiveness and assertiveness training as a stand-alone treatment within clinical psychology has diminished drastically. We review the history of assertiveness training, revisit early research evidence for assertiveness training in treating various clinical problems, discuss the current status of assertiveness training, consider issues of clinical implementation, and comment on how the variables accounting for unassertiveness map onto the NIMH RDoC funding priorities.},

abstract = {Although extensively discussed in theoretical papers, empirical studies of therapist emotional reactions to clients are lacking, particularly within the context of client resistance and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The present study examined the early positive and negative emotional reactions to clients of four therapists, together with observed client in-session resistance, and changes in resistance from early to midtreatment, in a sample of 30 outpatients receiving eight sessions (14 hr) of CBT for generalized anxiety disorder. Findings indicated that greater therapist early positive reactions to clients, especially liking, enjoyment, and attachment, were associated with significantly lower levels of client resistance midtreatment and greater reductions in client resistance from early to midtreatment. These effects were independent of therapist competence in delivering CBT, suggesting a potentially unique and important role for therapist feelings about clients beyond the skillful delivery of treatment techniques. Greater early negative therapist reactions to clients were less consistently related to client resistance but power struggles, and feeling drained, helpless, guilty, and frustrated were associated with higher levels of client subsequent resistance.},

@article{Kaltenthaler2006,
abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (CCBT) for the treatment of anxiety, depression, phobias, panic and obsessive–compulsive behaviour (OCD). The software packages to be considered include Beating the Blues (BtB), Overcoming Depression: a five areas approach, FearFighter (FF), Cope and BT Steps. Other packages or programmes incorporating CCBT were also considered. Data sources: Electronic databases from 1966 to March 2004. Evidence submitted by sponsors for CCBT products Review methods: A systematic review was performed to identify all studies describing trials of CCBT. The costeffectiveness assessment included a review of the literature and the evidence submitted by sponsors for each of the products. A series of cost-effectiveness models was developed and run by the project team for the five CCBT products across the three mental health conditions. Results: Twenty studies were identified in the clinical effectiveness review. The analysis of these results showed some evidence that CCBT is as effective as therapist-led cognitive behaviour therapy (TCBT) for the treatment of depression/anxiety and phobia/panic and is more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) in the treatment of depression/anxiety. CCBT also appears to reduce therapist time compared with TCBT. When reviewing cost-effectiveness studies, only one published economic evaluation of CCBT was found. This was an economic evaluation of the depression software BtB alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT), which found that BtB was cost-effective against TAU in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (less than {\pounds}2000), however it contained weaknesses that were then addressed in the costeffectiveness model developed for the study. The results of the model for the depression software packages in terms of incremental cost per QALY compared with TAU and the chance of being costeffective at {\pounds}30,000 per QALY were for BtB {\pounds}1801 and 86.8{\%}, for Cope {\pounds}7139 and 62.6{\%} and for Overcoming Depression {\pounds}5391 and 54.4{\%}. The strength of the BtB software being that it has been evaluated in the context of an RCT with a control group. The subgroup analysis found no differences across the severity groupings. For phobia/panic software, the model showed an incremental cost per QALY of FF over relaxation was {\pounds}2380. Its position compared with TCBT is less clear. When modelling OCD packages, using the practice-level licence cost meant that BT Steps was dominated by TCBT, which had significantly better outcomes and was cheaper. However, the cheaper PCT licence resulted in the incremental cost-effectiveness of BT Steps over relaxation being {\pounds}15,581 and TCBT over BT Steps being {\pounds}22,484. Conclusions: The study findings are subject to substantial uncertainties around the organisational level for purchasing these products and the likely throughput. This is in addition to concerns with the quality of evidence on response to therapy, longer term outcomes and quality of life. The position of CCBT within a stepped care programme needs to be identified, as well as its relationship to other efforts to increase access to CBT and psychological therapies. Research is needed to compare CCBT with other therapies that reduce therapist time, in particular bibliotherapy and to explore the use of CCBT via the Internet. Independent research is needed, particularly RCTs, that examine areas such as patient preference and therapist involvement within primary care.},

abstract = {An integrative model of short-term dynamic psycho- therapy (STDP) is presented that assimilates interven- tions from a variety of therapy orientations to acceler- ate patient improvement. Affect phobia therapy (APT) is a name given to McCullough's STDP to highlight the main treatment focus and to guide therapists to the most efficient and effective interventions. This treat- ment model is based on the hypothesis that conflicts about feelings, or “affect phobias,” are the fundamen- tal issues underlying many Axis I and Axis II disorders. Systematic desensitization, or stepwise exposure to feelings and defense response prevention, is hypothe- sized to be the fundamental agent of therapeutic change. APT focuses primarily on the resolution of af- fective conflicts in a psychodynamic framework, but videotape review and process studies of this STDP model have discovered that interventions from cogni- tive, behavior, Gestalt, and experiential therapy, as well as self-psychology, have been instrumental in patient change. Therapy is made briefer by clarifying treatment objectives, simplifying the selection criteria, and using principles of systematic desensitization for the resolu- tion of affect phobias.},

abstract = {Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) refers to a treatment approach with strong empirical support for its efficacy for various disorders and populations. The goal of the present review was to provide a comprehensive survey of meta-analyses examining the processes of CBT, namely: treatment processes (cognitive reappraisal, behavioral strategies, emotional regulation, motivation strategies, and psychoeducation) and in-session processes (alliance, goal consensus and collaboration, feedback, group cohesion, and homework). We identified 558 meta-analyses of CBT, and 30 meta-analyses met our inclusion criteria as reviews of process-outcome relations. For treatment processes, the strongest support currently exists for cognitive (n = 8 meta-analyses) and behavioral strategies (n = 3 meta-analyses) as change processes in CBT for anxiety disorders and depression. For in-session processes, the strongest support currently exists for the role of the alliance (n = 8 meta-analyses) and homework assignments (n = 6 meta-analyses) as predictors of outcome. Overall, the evidence base for process-outcome relations in CBT is just emerging. Additional research is needed to examine the range of treatment processes in various clinical contexts. Moreover, except for a meta-analysis on collaboration, no meta-analytic studies have been reported on CBT-specific elements of the therapeutic relationship, such as collaborative empiricism and Socratic dialogue.},

In this paper I briefly summarize the history of CBT, and list a number of current challenges that could be dangerous to the future health of CBT if they are ignored or mishandled. I make six recommendations that I believe will be of help going forward: focusing on theory and basic principles; embracing transdiagnostic thinking even more strongly; abandoning syndromal classification once and for all; creating a functional diagnostic system with treatment utility; integrating biology into behavioral science by aligning with modern multidimensional, multilevel evolution science; and becoming more serious about delivery systems. The future of CBT could be exciting if we are able to adjust to changing conditions in a flexible way.},

Although many assertiveness instruments have been developed for research and clinical purposes, one common shortcoming is a lack of discriminant validity with regard to aggression. Further, the wording of many instruments is outdated and discriminatory. The goal of the present research was to develop a more sensitive instrument measuring two distinguishable forms of assertiveness: adaptive assertiveness and aggressive assertiveness. We present data validating such a measure, the Adaptive and Aggressive Assertiveness Scales (AAA-S). Participants included two samples of college students and a clinical sample of adults with anxiety disorders. The AAA-S demonstrated good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The aggressive assertiveness scale was associated with various forms of aggression and peer reports of aggressive assertiveness. The adaptive assertiveness scale was associated with competence and peer reports of adaptive assertiveness. Importantly, there were no gender differences in adaptive assertiveness.

@article{Andersson2016,
abstract = {Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of being scrutinized by others in social situations. It is highly prevalent and follows a chronic course for many affected if untreated. Treatment with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be highly effective for SAD with responder rates of 50-75 {\%}. For more than a decade, Internet-based CBT (ICBT) has been researched and evidence has been provided by four independent research groups. In essence, most forms of ICBT for SAD can generally be described as therapist-guided Internet-based self-help CBT where a named therapist guides the client through the treatment. The treatments are manualized and highly structured comprising 5-15 modules or lessons, which are the equivalent of sessions in face-to-face CBT. The existing treatments for SAD all have vital features in common including that they are based in CBT, comprise the same interventions as have been shown to be effective in face-to-face CBT, have large amount of psychoeducational material, and use asynchronous text messages as the main communication between patient and therapist. ICBT for SAD has been proven to be effective in at least 16 randomized trials and found to be non-inferior to face-to-face CBT. A few studies suggest that ICBT is a cost-effective treatment. Since SAD is known to appear at an early age in most cases, one central future challenge is to increase the body of knowledge on ICBT for children and adolescents. For adults, ICBT for SAD is clearly an effective treatment and a promising option for increasing accessibility to evidence-based psychological treatment.
