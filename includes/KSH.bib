abstract = {Introduction: The aim of this study was to systematically review the impact of guidance on the efficacy of Internet-based interventions. Methods: Included were RCTs with a comparison of (1) guided vs. unguided interventions, (2) different doses of guidance, (3) different qualification levels of e-coaches, and (4) synchronous vs. asynchronous communication mode. Outcomes were symptom severity, completer rates and number of completed intervention modules. A systematic search of MEDLINE, CENTRAL and PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and Psyndex (search date 4th June 2013) was conducted, as well as a hand search of trial-registers and the reference lists of included articles. Methodological quality was rated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Relevant study characteristics and outcome data were extracted. Random-effects analyses were conducted if appropriate. Results: 5328 articles were retrieved of which 14 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Guided interventions were significantly superior to unguided interventions ((symptom severity: standardized mean difference (. SMD). =. -. .27 [. 95{\%} CI: -. .45; -. .10]), n. =. 8; completed modules: SMD=. .52 [.37; .67], n. =. 7; completer rate: OR=. 2.76 [1.68; 4.53], n. =. 6). The four trials that examined different levels of e-coach qualification showed no significant differences on either of the outcome measures. Only one trial each examined the remaining two research questions, without significant effects on either of the outcome measures. Conclusions: Guidance is a beneficial feature of Internet-based interventions, although its effect is smaller than reported before when compared to unguided interventions. The qualification of the e-coaches seems of minor importance. However, methodological limitations need to be considered when interpreting these findings. Overall, the number of studies was small and mainly limited to depression and social phobia restricting the generalizability of the findings.},

abstract = {Although Skinner's Verbal Behavior (1957) was published over 50 years ago, behavior-analytic research on human language and cognition has been slow to develop. In recent years, a new behavioral approach to language known as relational frame theory (RFT) has generated considerable attention, research, and debate. The controversy surrounding RFT can be difficult to fully appreciate, partly because of the complexity of the theory itself and partly because the debate has spanned several years and several journals. The current paper aims to provide a concise overview of RFT and a summary of key points of debate and controversy.},

abstract = {Background: The current study explored whether higher- (up to 8 modules) versus lower-dose (3 or less modules) unguided internet Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for perfectionism (ICBT-P) was more effective, and the best method to promote higher dosage. Methods: Two sequential randomised ICBT-P studies were conducted with participants who self-identified as having difficulties with perfectionism; in the first participants (N = 51) received 3-module ICBT-P or wait-list, and in the second participants (N = 55) received fixed (asked to complete all 8 modules two per week over 4-weeks) or flexible format (after completing the first psychoeducational module, participants decided how many/in what order they completed the modules). We examined impact on our primary variables, perfectionistic concerns and standards, and secondary outcomes of negative affect, body image flexibility, and self-efficacy. Results: More modules were completed in the higher- (M modules = 4.36, SD = 3.29) versus lower-dose (M = 1.96, SD = 1.23) ICBT-P, d = 0.86 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.39, 1.34). The latter impacted perfectionism but not secondary outcomes; the former impacted all outcomes (except for self-efficacy), and within-group effect size improvements were double in the high- compared to low-dose ICBT-P. There was no difference between the fixed and flexible formats in terms of the number of modules completed or impact. Conclusions: We can offer a patient-centred approach to ICBT-P that is effective, while suggesting completion of more modules can result in larger, more pervasive improvements.

abstract = {To investigate how coping behaviors may be preconditioned by assertiveness and locus of control, a questionnaire was given to 133 undergraduates of whom 87{\%} reported recent tension attributed mainly to academic pressures. From a list of 22 common coping reactions, the students were asked to check those they use to deal with their tensions. The coping responses were also correlated with scores on an assertiveness inventory (AES) and Rotters Internal-External Locus of Control (I-E) Scale. Reliance on ones own initiatives and turning to significant others were the responses most frequently reported as reactions to tension while seeking professional help was ranked last. Male students more frequently reported using marijuana or seeking sexual comfort than females, while females more frequently reported dysfunctional reactions such as spending endless hours thinking about the problem. The AES correlated significantly with problem-solvingapproaches. The IE Scale showed internals more inclined to meditate;externalsindicated a greater likelihood to seek professional help, fantasize, or drink alcohol. {\textcopyright} 1979, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.

abstract = {Intuition suggests that perception follows sensation and therefore bodily feelings originate in the body. However, recent evidence goes against this logic: interoceptive experience may largely reflect limbic predictions about the expected state of the body that are constrained by ascending visceral sensations. In this Opinion article, we introduce the Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding model, which integrates an anatomical model of corticocortical connections with Bayesian active inference principles, to propose that agranular visceromotor cortices contribute to interoception by issuing interoceptive predictions. We then discuss how disruptions in interoceptive predictions could function as a common vulnerability for mental and physical illness. For many decades, neuroscientists understood the brain as a 'stimulus–response' organ, consisting of individual neurons that lie dormant until stimulated. In this traditional model, learning and experience merely modulate neural activity that is driven by sensory events in the world. In recent years, scientists have come to realize that the brain probably does not work this way. Instead, research and theory are converging on the idea of the brain as an active inference generator that functions according to a Bayesian approach to probability: sensory inputs constrain estimates of prior probability (from past experience) to create the posterior probabilities that serve as beliefs about the causes of such inputs in the present 1,2 .},

abstract = {Aims: To test the efficacy of a therapist-guided high-intensity internet intervention compared with an unguided low-intensity internet intervention among individuals with alcohol use disorder. Design: A three-group randomized controlled trial with follow-up assessments post-treatment (12 weeks) and 6 months post-randomization (primary end-point). Settings: General population sample in Sweden. Participants: A total of 166 on-line self-referred adults (49{\%} males) with a score of 14 (females)/16 (males) or more on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, a preceding week alcohol consumption of 11 (females)/14 (males) or more standard drinks and an alcohol use disorder according to a diagnostic interview. Interventions and comparators: Both the high- (n = 72) and low-intensity internet interventions (n = 71) consisted of modules based on relapse prevention. Controls were on a waiting-list (n = 23), and were only followed until the post-treatment follow-up. Participants were randomized at a 7 : 7 : 2 ratio. Measurements: Primary outcome was self-reported alcohol consumption in the preceding week measured as (1) number of standard drinks and (2) number of heavy drinking days at the 6-month follow-up. Findings: Alcohol use disorders were largely in the severe category (74.7{\%}), with the majority of participants having had alcohol problems for more than 5 years. Attrition was 13 and 22{\%} at the post-treatment and 6-month follow-up, respectively. At the 6-month follow-up, an intent-to-treat analysis showed no significant differences in alcohol consumption between the high- and low-intensity interventions [standard drinks d = −0.17, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = −0.50 to 0.16; heavy drinking days: d = −0.07, 95{\%} CI = −0.40 to 0.26]. Prevalence of negative effects was somewhat low (8–14{\%}) in both intervention groups, as was deterioration (3–5{\%}). Conclusions: At 6-month follow-up, there were no significant differences between a therapist-guided high-intensity internet intervention and an unguided low-intensity internet intervention in reducing alcohol consumption among individuals with an alcohol use disorder.},

The intention of this article is to share our experience with developing such a treatment solution and the process flow and elements of running internet-based psychological interventions. This will likely be of use to developers building similar services, therapists considering integrating such approaches in their practices and institutions, as well as researchers curious about the functions included on the platform and methodology used for running studies. We describe the security aspects of the platform, central concepts underlying its development, how the platform can be used in a study or treatment and the main features and functions the platform offers. We comment on practical considerations regarding blending of methods within the platform, such as self-help treatments with asynchronous communication and real-time text chat and video conversations. We also point out the advantages of using Internet-assisted treatments, the challenges that we have faced and future planned upgrades. Due to continuous development of the platform, its user-friendliness, accessibility across devices and numerous features, many research colleagues from Sweden as well as other countries such as Germany, United Kingdom, Romania and Israel have chosen to implement their own studies on the platform.},

This review describes the most common MRT techniques, summarizes recent evidence of their effectiveness in treating anxiety, and explains their rationale and physiological basis. We conclude that although GAD and PD patients may exhibit elevated muscle tension and abnormal autonomic and respiratory measures during laboratory baseline assessments, the available evidence does not allow us to conclude that physiological activation decreases over the course of MRT in GAD and PD patients, even when patients report becoming less anxious. Better-designed studies will be required to identify the mechanisms of MRT and to advance clinical practice. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Fernandez-Rodriguez2018,
abstract = {Background: From a contextual transdiagnostic approach, this study focuses on the importance of the processes of Experiential Avoidance and Activation in explaining and treating psychological problems. There exists widespread empirical evidence to suggest that the response pattern known as Experiential Avoidance, a general unwillingness to remain in contact with particular private experiences through the use of maladaptive avoidance strategies, acts as a functional dimension in various psychological problems. Activation, that is, maintaining contact with experiences/conditions of life and consequently with associated sources of reward, is a condition present in most therapeutic processes. Although a great deal of research has analyzed the relationship of the value of reward with the etiology and maintenance of psychological problems, Activation, as a transdiagnostic factor, has been studied less. The aim of this paper is to carry out an empirical study of the relationship between Activation, EA and emotional state and analyze the capacity of these two conditions to discriminate the intensity and symptomatology type in subjects with emotional distress. Methods: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Environmental Reward Observation Scale (EROS) and Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS) were completed by 240 health center users. Results: Of the participants, 55{\%} showed clinically relevant emotional distress. All cases of depression showed clinical anxiety. To discriminate between subjects without (n = 109) and with emotional distress (n = 131), analyses of the ROC curves and logistic regression analysis identified the BADS-Avoidance/Rumination followed by the EROS. To discriminate between subjects with anxiety but without depression (n = 61) and with anxiety and depression (n = 70), the most efficient scales were EROS followed by BADS-Social Impairment. Conclusion: It was shown that people with no emotional complaints maintained greater contact with life experiences and with environmental sources of reward than those with emotional distress. Response patterns showing Experiential Avoidance and a reduction in Activation responses were associated with clinical distress. A reduction in Activation was the condition which distinguished those people with the greatest distress and also the greatest comorbidity of symptoms of depression and anxiety. These data support the transdiagnostic nature of Activation and suggest greater attention should be paid to this concept.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to develop a measure for functional assertiveness, the Functional Assertiveness Scale (FAS). Functional assertiveness is a new concept of assertiveness that represents a method of appropriate self-expression. Functional assertiveness is defined as interpersonal communication that occurs when a speaker encounters interpersonal problems that should be resolved or has objectives that should be achieved, and the speaker's message is perceived as appropriate by the listener (Mitamura {\&} Tanaka-Matsumi, 2010, 2010c). Five studies were conducted in order to develop the FAS. In Study 1, we generated an item pool for FAS, and in Study 2 we developed the FAS prototype using this item pool. Study 3 examined the factorial validity, concurrent validity, and internal consistency of the FAS. Study 4 examined test–retest reliability of the FAS. Study 5 examined responsiveness on the FAS. The validity and reliability of the FAS and potential utility and clinical implication of the FAS are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

abstract = {Anxiety disorders (separation anxiety disorder, selective mutism, specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and generalised anxiety disorder) are common and disabling conditions that mostly begin during childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. They differ from developmentally normative or stress-induced transient anxiety by being marked (ie, out of proportion to the actual threat present) and persistent, and by impairing daily functioning. Most anxiety disorders affect almost twice as many women as men. They often co-occur with major depression, alcohol and other substance-use disorders, and personality disorders. Differential diagnosis from physical conditions—including thyroid, cardiac, and respiratory disorders, and substance intoxication and withdrawal—is imperative. If untreated, anxiety disorders tend to recur chronically. Psychological treatments, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy, and pharmacological treatments, particularly selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and serotonin–noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitors, are effective, and their combination could be more effective than is treatment with either individually. More research is needed to increase access to and to develop personalised treatments.},

A systematic database search was conducted of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and Cochrane for relevant studies published from 1990 to September 2018. A study was included if the following criteria were met: (1) randomized controlled trial involving an ICBT intervention; (2) participants experienced a chronic health condition; (3) participants ≥ 18 years of age; and (4) effects of ICBT on anxiety and/or depression were reported. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias on the included studies. Pooled analysis was conducted on the primary and condition specific secondary outcomes. Twenty-five studies met inclusion criteria and investigated the following chronic health conditions: tinnitus (n = 6), fibromyalgia (n = 3), pain (n = 7), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 3), cardiovascular disease (n = 2), diabetes (n = 1), cancer (n = 1), heterogeneous chronic disease population (n = 1), and spinal cord injury (n = 1). Pooled analysis demonstrated small effects of ICBT in improving anxiety and depression. Moderate effects of therapist-guided approach were seen for depression and anxiety outcomes; while, self-guided approaches resulted in small effects for depression and moderate effects in anxiety outcomes. ICBT shows promise as an alternative to traditional face-to-face interventions among persons with chronic health conditions. Future research on long-term effects of ICBT for individuals with chronic health conditions is needed. Trial Registration PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018087292.},

abstract = {Purpose: Ethnic and cultural norms influence an individual's assertiveness. In health care, assertiveness may play an important role in health outcomes, especially for predominantly minority populations, such as adults with sickle cell disease. Therefore, it is important to develop measures to accurately assess assertiveness. It is also important to reduce response burden of lengthy instruments while retaining instrument reliability and validity. The purpose of this article is to describe development of a shorter version of the Simple Rathus Assertiveness Schedule (SRAS). Design: Data from a cross-sectional descriptive study of adults with sickle cell disease were used to construct a short form of the SRAS, guided by stepwise regression analysis. Results: The 19-item Simple Rathus Assertiveness Scale'Short Form (SRAS-SF) had acceptable reliability ($\alpha$ =.81) and construct validity and was highly correlated with the SRAS (r =.98, p =.01). Conclusions: The SRAS-SF reduces response burden, while maintaining reliability and validity. {\textcopyright} 2010, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

@article{Barrett2007,
abstract = {For almost 5 decades, the scientific study of emotion has been guided by the assumption that categories such as anger, sadness, and fear cut nature at its joints. Barrett (2006a) provided a comprehensive review of the empirical evidence from the study of emotion in humans and concluded that this assumption has outlived its usefulness. Panksepp and Izard have written lengthy papers (published in this issue) containing complementary but largely nonover lapping criticisms of Barrett (2006a). In our response, we address three of their concerns. First, we discuss the value of correlational versus experimental studies for evaluating the natural-kind model of emotion and refute the claim that the evidence offered in Barrett (2006a) was merely correlational. Second, we take up the issue of whether or not there is evidence for “coherently organized neural circuits for natural kinds of emotions in the mammalian brain and counter the claim that Barrett (2006a) ignored crucial evidence for existence of discrete emotions as natural kinds. Third, we address Panksepp and Izard's misconceptions of an alternative view, the conceptual act model of emotion, that was briefly discussed in Barrett (2006a). Finally, we end the article with some thoughts on how to move the scientific study of emotion beyond the debate over whether or not emotions are natural kinds. {\textcopyright} 2007, Association for Psychological Science.

abstract = {The present study investigated perceived acceptability and suppression of negative emotion in participants with anxiety and mood disorders. Sixty participants with these disorders and 30 control participants watched an emotion-provoking film and completed self-report measures of their experience and regulation of emotions. The film elicited similar increases in negative emotion for clinical and nonclinical participants; however, clinical participants judged their resulting emotions as less acceptable and suppressed their emotions to a greater extent. The higher level of suppression in the clinical group was attributable to females in the clinical group suppressing their emotions more than females in the nonclinical group. For all participants, high levels of suppression were associated with increased negative emotion during the film and during a postfilm recovery period. Further analyses showed that appraising emotions as unacceptable mediated the relationship between negative emotion intensity and use of suppression in the clinical group. This study extends the literature on emotion regulation to a clinical sample and suggests that judging emotions as unacceptable and suppressing emotions may be important aspects of the phenomenology of emotional disorders.},

This meta-analysis includes all RCTs of CBT (25) and SRI (9) for OCD in youth using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (C-YBOCS). CBT yielded significantly lower attrition (12.7{\%}) than SRI (23.5{\%}) and placebo (24.7{\%}). The effect sizes for comparisons of CBT with waiting-list (1.53), placebo (0.93), and SRI with placebo (0.51) were significant, whereas CBT vs. SRI (0.22) and Combo (CBT + SRI) vs. CBT (0.14) were not. Regarding response rate CBT (70{\%}) and Combo (66{\%}) were significantly higher than SRI (49{\%}), which was higher than placebo (29{\%}) and WLC (13{\%}). As for remission CBT (53{\%}) and Combo (49{\%}) were significantly higher than SRI (24{\%}), placebo (15{\%}), and WLC (10{\%}), which did not differ from each other. Combo was not more effective than CBT alone irrespective of initial severity of the samples.

abstract = {Exposure, the repeated and systematic confrontation with feared stimuli, is a central component of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for anxiety and threat-related disorders. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials over the past several decades have demonstrated very large effect sizes for exposure therapy for anxiety disorders, whether alone or combined with coping strategies such as cognitive reappraisal or breathing/relaxation training. Numerous strategies translated from basic fear learning research can be implemented during exposure to enhance inhibitory learning. These methods include enhancing inhibitory learning through: expectancy violation, removal of safety signals, attentional focus, deepened extinction, stimulus variability, occasional reinforced extinction, and enhancing retrieval of inhibitory learning via multiple contexts and retrieval cues. This chapter focuses on ways to implement and capitalize on these strategies within treatment to achieve superior extinction learning. Overall, the translation of inhibitory learning principles into exposure therapy is an exciting and critical step forward toward science-driven practice.

abstract = {Background: There is ongoing debate about the efficacy of placebos in the treatment of mental disorders. In randomized control trials (RCTs) about the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, the administration of a psychological placebo or placement on a waiting list are the two most common control conditions. But there has never been a systematic comparison of the clinical effect of these different strategies. Aim: Compare the change in symptom severity among individuals treated with cognitive behavioral therapy, provided a psychological placebo, or placed on a waiting list using data from RCTs on generalized anxiety disorder. Methods: The following databases were searched for RCTs on generalized anxiety disorder: PubMed, PsycInfo, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, Chongqing VIP, Wanfang, Chinese Biological Medical Literature Database, and Taiwan Electronic Periodical Services. Studies were selected based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria and the quality of each included study - based on the risk of bias and the level of evidence - was formally assessed. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan5.3 and network meta-analyses comparing the three groups were conducted using R. Results: Twelve studies with a combined sample size of 531 were included in the analysis. Compared to either control method (placebo or waiting list), cognitive behavioral therapy was more effective for generalized anxiety disorder. Provision of a psychological placebo was associated with a significantly greater reduction of symptoms than placement on a waiting list. Eight of the studies were classified as 'high risk of bias', and the overall level of evidence was classified as 'moderate', indicating that further research could change the overall results of the meta-analysis. Conclusions: RCTs about the treatment of generalized anxiety disorders are generally of moderate quality; they indicate the superiority of CBT but the results cannot, as yet, be considered robust. There is evidence of a non-negligible treatment effect of psychological placebos used as control conditions in research studies. This effect should be considered when designing and interpreting the results of randomized controlled trials about the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions.},

abstract = {Aim. This paper reviews the key research literature regarding men's health-related help seeking behaviour. Background. There is a growing body of research in the United States to suggest that men are less likely than women to seek help from health professionals for problems as diverse as depression, substance abuse, physical disabilities and stressful life events. Previous research has revealed that the principle health related issue facing men in the UK is their reluctance to seek access to health services. Method. The investigation of men's health-related help seeking behaviour has great potential for improving both men and women's lives and reducing national health costs through the development of responsive and effective interventions. A search of the literature was conducted using CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Library databases. Results. Studies comparing men and women are inadequate in explaining the processes involved in men's help seeking behaviour. However, the growing body of gender-specific studies highlights a trend of delayed help seeking when they become ill. A prominent theme among white middle class men implicates 'traditional masculine behaviour' as an explanation for delays in seeking help among men who experience illness. The reasons and processes behind this issue, however, have received limited attention. Conclusions. Principally, the role of masculine beliefs and the similarities and differences between men of differing background requires further attention, particularly given the health inequalities that exist between men of differing socio-economic status and ethnicity. Further research using heterogeneous samples is required in order to gain a greater understanding of the triggers and barriers associated with the decision making process of help seeking behaviour in men who experience illness. {\textcopyright} 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@incollection{Barnes-Holmes2016,
abstract = {The following two chapters (9 and 10) by Hughes and Barnes‐Holmes in this part of the CBS handbook provide a very detailed and systematic review of relational frame theory (RFT) and its evidence. As such, there seems little point in recapitulating some of that work in this opening chapter of Part II. Furthermore, the subsequent two chapters provide examples of how RFT has been applied in the domains of educational (chapter 11, Barnes‐Holmes, Kavanagh, {\&} Murphy) and clinical psychology (chapter 12, T{\"{o}}rneke, Luciano, Barnes‐Holmes, {\&} Bond). The current part therefore provides a comprehensive overview of the basic and applied wings of RFT. By way of narrative or commentary, this opening chapter aims to provide a particular perspective, perhaps somewhat controversial at the present time, on the history and future development of the account itself. We begin here by asking the question: What are the historical and intellectual roots of RFT? The seminal volume contains a narrative by Steve Hayes, which addresses the origins of the theory from the personal perspective of the person who first conceptu­ alized the account (Hayes, Barnes‐Holmes, {\&} Roche, 2001). However, we are asking a broader and perhaps more fundamental question here. Why did Steve come up with RFT at that time? Or, in other words, what was the confluence of historical and intel­ lectual variables that led him to do so, and subsequently supported the theory's development and continued growth to this day? Here is our view on the matter.},

A sample of 972 first-year college students between 17 and 20 years of age completed self-report measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress as well as a structured diagnostic interview. Psychological inflexibility was significantly higher across a range of current and lifetime depressive and anxiety disorders as well as lifetime history of eating disorders, relative to students with no disorder, even after controlling for general psychological distress. Findings were mixed for substance use disorders, with a more consistent pattern for lifetime history than for current disorders. Psychological inflexibility was also related to having comorbid depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders relative to only having one of these diagnoses. Results are discussed in relation to research on psychological inflexibility as a transdiagnostic pathological process and target for interventions.},

abstract = {In successful multiple exemplar training, a set of exemplars that sample the range of stimulus and response topographies is trained, and the full range of performances results. Examples abound in experimental psychology and include abstraction and concept learning, responding to relations, identity matching, rule following, behavioral variability, responding to wh-questions, describing past events, learning sets, and continuous repertoires. Thus, behavior analysts often allude to a history of multiple exemplar training to account for different generalized performances. It is easy to see how a strategy of multiple exemplar training can work with many types of performances, even performances that involve relations between objects or events. However, there appear to be at least two exceptions, where direct multiple exemplar training does not work well: (1) when there are no physical dimensions at all along which generalized performances can emerge, and (2) when the relation between a stimulus and an effective response is complex. Interpretation of the latter type of cases in terms of mediated generalization is outlined and discussed. An experimental and conceptual research program should produce an account of the general limits of multiple exemplar training, and guidelines for the most effective training for generalized skills.},

abstract = {Background It is a widespread opinion that after treatment with psychotherapy, patients with anxiety disorders maintain their gains beyond the active treatment period, whereas patients treated with medication soon experience a relapse after treatment termination. Aims We aimed to provide evidence on whether enduring effects of psychotherapy differ from control groups. Method We searched 93 randomised controlled studies with 152 study arms of psychological treatment (cognitive-behavioural therapy or other psychotherapies) for panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder that included follow-up assessments. In a meta-Analysis, pre-post effect sizes for end-point and all follow-up periods were calculated and compared with control groups (medication: n = 16 study arms; pill and psychological placebo groups: n = 17 study arms). Results Gains with psychotherapy were maintained for up to 24 months. For cognitive-behavioural therapy, we observed a significant improvement over time. However, patients in the medication group remained stable during the treatment-free period, with no significant difference when compared with psychotherapy. Patients in the placebo group did not deteriorate during follow-up, but showed significantly worse outcomes than patients in cognitive-behavioural therapy. Conclusions Not only psychotherapy, but also medications and, to a lesser extent, placebo conditions have enduring effects. Long-lasting treatment effects observed in the follow-up period may be superimposed by effects of spontaneous remission or regression to the mean.

abstract = {Objective: Our aim in this randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effects on global tinnitus severity of 2 Internet-delivered psychological treatments, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), in guided self-help format. Method: Ninety-nine participants (mean age = 48.5 years; 43{\%} female) who were significantly distressed by tinnitus were recruited from the community. Participants were randomly assigned to CBT (n = 32), ACT (n = 35), or a control condition (monitored Internet discussion forum; n = 32), and they were assessed with standardized self-report measures (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Quality of Life Inventory; Perceived Stress Scale; Tinnitus Acceptance Questionnaire) at pre-, posttreatment (8 weeks), and 1-year follow-up. Results: Mixed-effects linear regression analysis of all randomized participants showed significant effects on the primary outcome (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory) for CBT and for ACT compared with control at posttreatment (95{\%} CI [-17.03,-2.94], d = 0.70, and 95{\%} CI [-16.29,-2.53], d = 0.68, respectively). Within-group effects were substantial from pretreatment through 1-year-follow-up for both treatments (95{\%} CI [-44.65,-20.45], d = 1.34), with no significant difference between treatments (95{\%} CI [-14.87, 11.21], d = 0.16).

We tested a cognitive-behavioral framework for understanding the self-reported enactment of diverse types of assertive behaviours (i.e., displaying negative and positive feelings, expressing and managing personal limitations, and taking initiative), using a sample of 679 adolescents (mean age = 16.68, 261 boys) and a model generation approach to structural equation modelling. Cognition directly predicted lower distress and more frequent assertive behavior; also, cognition indirectly predicted assertive behavior through distress. Interpersonal management was the most salient cognitive theme predicting various types of assertive behaviors, alongside feeling less distressed when displaying negative feelings. Evidence was found for cognitive-behavioral theories being a valid approach to understanding assertiveness and sustaining insights for efficacious assertive training. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The common practice of nesting therapists within conditions can pose important methodological challenges that affect interpretation, particularly if the study is not powered to account for the nested design. An obstacle to the optimal design of these studies is the lack of data about the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which measures the statistical dependencies introduced by nesting. To begin the development of a public database of ICC estimates, the authors investigated ICCs for a variety outcomes reported in 20 psychotherapy outcome studies. The magnitude of the 495 ICC estimates varied widely across measures and studies. The authors provide recommendations regarding how to select and aggregate ICC estimates for power calculations and show how researchers can use ICC estimates to choose the number of patients and therapists that will optimize power. Attention to these recommendations will strengthen the validity of inferences drawn from psychotherapy studies that nest therapists within conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Swedish Association for Behaviour Therapy.},

Posttreatment, intention-to-treat analyses revealed that both treatments were effective at improving panic disorder and agoraphobia severity ratings, panic-related cognitions, negative affect, and psychological and physical quality of life domains, with no differences between conditions. High end-state functioning was achieved by 28.6{\%} of the frequent and infrequent participants, respectively. Therapist alliance, treatment credibility, and satisfaction also did not differ between groups, despite significantly greater therapist time invested in the frequent contact condition.

The goal of the present review was to provide a comprehensive survey of meta-analyses examining the processes of CBT, namely: treatment processes (cognitive reappraisal, behavioral strategies, emotional regulation, motivation strategies, and psychoeducation) and in-session processes (alliance, goal consensus and collaboration, feedback, group cohesion, and homework). We identified 558 meta-analyses of CBT, and 30 meta-analyses met our inclusion criteria as reviews of process-outcome relations. For treatment processes, the strongest support currently exists for cognitive (n = 8 meta-analyses) and behavioral strategies (n = 3 meta-analyses) as change processes in CBT for anxiety disorders and depression. For in-session processes, the strongest support currently exists for the role of the alliance (n = 8 meta-analyses) and homework assignments (n = 6 meta-analyses) as predictors of outcome. Overall, the evidence base for process-outcome relations in CBT is just emerging. Additional research is needed to examine the range of treatment processes in various clinical contexts. Moreover, except for a meta-analysis on collaboration, no meta-analytic studies have been reported on CBT-specific elements of the therapeutic relationship, such as collaborative empiricism and Socratic dialogue.},

The purposes of this review article of third wave treatment RCTs were: (1) to describe and review them methodologically, (2) to meta-analytically assess their efficacy, and (3) to evaluate if they currently fulfil the criteria for empirically supported treatments. There are 13 RCTs both in ACT and DBT, 1 in CBASP, 2 in IBCT, and none in FAP. The conclusions that can be drawn are that the third wave treatment RCTs used a research methodology that was significantly less stringent than CBT studies; that the mean effect size was moderate for both ACT and DBT, and that none of the third wave therapies fulfilled the criteria for empirically supported treatments. The article ends with suggestions on how to improve future RCTs to increase the possibility of them becoming empirically supported treatments.},

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to contribute to assertiveness research and assess the differences in assertiveness as it relates to gender, national culture, and ethnicity. Design/methodology/approach – The data for the study are from 231 undergraduate students majoring in business at one of four academic institutions: three in the USA and one in the Republic of Vietnam. Students completed the 30-item Rathus Assertiveness Schedule. Findings – This research suggests that individuals who are alike in level of education and status demonstrate similar levels of assertiveness, regardless of gender, national culture, or ethnicity. However, differences were seen as the data show white American males to be the most assertive, with African American females next. White females ranked third, followed by Vietnamese females, concluding with Vietnamese males. Research limitations/implications – Although the sample size is small, the intent of this research was never to have the subjects represent the general population in terms of the variables used. Instead, the authors attempted to control for gender, culture, and ethnicity variables by using a sample of college students who were similar in relation to education and social status. Future research could more fully research the findings from this study which suggest that African American women are more assertive than all other groups with the exception of white males. Originality/value – This study also gives credence to the suggestion that the global manager, in order to become more effective, needs to fully understand employee differences as represented by gender, national culture, and ethnicity.},

abstract = {Background: Depression, anxiety and somatization are the most common mental disorders in primary care as well as medical specialty populations; each is present in at least 5-10{\%} of patients and frequently comorbid with one another. An efficient means for measuring and monitoring all three conditions would be desirable. Methods: Evidence regarding the psychometric and pragmatic characteristics of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)-7 anxiety and PHQ-15 somatic symptom scales are synthesized from two sources: (1) four multisite cross-sectional studies (three conducted in primary care and one in obstetric-gynecology practices) comprising 9740 patients, and (2) key studies from the literature that have studied these scales. Results: The PHQ-9 and its abbreviated eight-item (PHQ-8) and two-item (PHQ-2) versions have good sensitivity and specificity for detecting depressive disorders. Likewise, the GAD-7 and its abbreviated two-item (GAD-2) version have good operating characteristics for detecting generalized anxiety, panic, social anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The optimal cutpoint is ≥10 on the parent scales (PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and ≥3 on the ultra-brief versions (PHQ-2 and GAD-2). The PHQ-15 is equal or superior to other brief measures for assessing somatic symptoms and screening for somatoform disorders. Cutpoints of 5, 10 and 15 represent mild, moderate and severe symptom levels on all three scales. Sensitivity to change is well-established for the PHQ-9 and emerging albeit not yet definitive for the GAD-7 and PHQ-15. Conclusions: The PHQ-9, GAD-7 and PHQ-15 are brief well-validated measures for detecting and monitoring depression, anxiety and somatization. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

However, the evidence, reviewed herein, indicates that neither the degree by which fear reduces nor the ending fear level predict therapeutic outcome. Developments in the theory and science of fear extinction, and learning and memory, indicate that 'performance during training' is not commensurate with learning at the process level. Inhibitory learning is recognized as being central to extinction and access to secondary inhibitory associations is subject to influences such as context and time, rather than fear during extinction training. Strategies for enhancing inhibitory learning, and its retrieval over time and context, are reviewed along with their clinical implications for exposure therapy and directions for future research.},

abstract = {Although extensively discussed in theoretical papers, empirical studies of therapist emotional reactions to clients are lacking, particularly within the context of client resistance and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The present study examined the early positive and negative emotional reactions to clients of four therapists, together with observed client in-session resistance, and changes in resistance from early to midtreatment, in a sample of 30 outpatients receiving eight sessions (14 hr) of CBT for generalized anxiety disorder. Findings indicated that greater therapist early positive reactions to clients, especially liking, enjoyment, and attachment, were associated with significantly lower levels of client resistance midtreatment and greater reductions in client resistance from early to midtreatment. These effects were independent of therapist competence in delivering CBT, suggesting a potentially unique and important role for therapist feelings about clients beyond the skillful delivery of treatment techniques. Greater early negative therapist reactions to clients were less consistently related to client resistance but power struggles, and feeling drained, helpless, guilty, and frustrated were associated with higher levels of client subsequent resistance.},

Aims: This study addressed therapist factors in guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders. Method: Data from three controlled trials with a total N of 119 were analyzed with attention to differences between eight therapists. Results: No significant mean level differences between therapists appeared in the dataset. However, one significant intraclass correlation between participants was found, suggesting that the outcome on the Beck Anxiety Inventory might have been influenced by the impact of the individual therapists. Conclusion: The therapist can possibly have some influence on the outcome of guided internet-delivered CBT for anxiety disorders, but studies with more statistical power are needed to establish whether therapist effects are present in this modality of psychological treatment.

abstract = {Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown efficacious, but the challenge remains to make it available and accessible in order to meet population needs. Delivering CBT-I over the internet (eCBT-I) may be one method to overcome this challenge. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of eCBT-I and the moderating influence of various study characteristics. Two researchers independently searched key electronic databases (1991 to June 2015), selected eligible publications, extracted data, and evaluated methodological quality. Eleven randomized controlled trials examining a total of 1460 participants were included. Results showed that eCBT-I improved insomnia severity, sleep efficiency, subjective sleep quality, wake after sleep onset, sleep onset latency, total sleep time, and number of nocturnal awakenings at post-treatment, with effect sizes (Hedges's g) ranging from 0.21 to 1.09. The effects were comparable to those found for face-to-face CBT-I, and were generally maintained at 4-48 wk follow-up. Moderator analyses showed that longer treatment duration and higher degree of personal clinical support were associated with larger effect sizes, and that larger study dropout in the intervention group was associated with smaller effect sizes. In conclusion, internet-delivered CBT-I appears efficacious and can be considered a viable option in the treatment of insomnia.},

@article{Vagos2016,
abstract = {Assertiveness has for long been considered an optimal way of expressing oneself while at the same time maintaining and/or enhancing social rewards, leading to the conclusion that it should be promoted as an intra and interpersonal protective factor. Yet, few researchers have tried to provide a comprehensive model on assertiveness that may better sustain why and how to train it. We propose a cognitive model for explaining how assertiveness comes to be enacted and maintained, considering the activation of previous individual schemas, how they influence the processing of social cues, which in turn influence the interactive activation of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral assertive products. The assertive behavior in turn prompts reactions from the interaction partner. This interpersonal exchange will serve to confirm previous schemas and make them more accessible when facing future social events. We further review previous findings on several assumptions involved in this model and propose how these findings can sustain cognitive-behavioral approaches to assertive training, building on the premises that the intrapersonal psychological functioning is manifested in interpersonal observed behaviors. Subsequently, new directions for the study and training of assertiveness based on a social information-processing framework are discussed, also considering the current social challenges and contexts that we, as human beings, must face.},

abstract = {Background: Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (wCBT) has been proposed as a possible treatment for patients with heart failure and depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms are common in patients with heart failure and such symptoms are known to significantly worsen their health. Although there are promising results on the effect of wCBT, there is a knowledge gap regarding how persons with chronic heart failure and depressive symptoms experience wCBT. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore and describe the experiences of participating and receiving health care through a wCBT intervention among persons with heart failure and depressive symptoms. Methods: In this qualitative, inductive, exploratory, and descriptive study, participants with experiences of a wCBT program were interviewed. The participants were included through purposeful sampling among participants previously included in a quantitative study on wCBT. Overall, 13 participants consented to take part in this study and were interviewed via telephone using an interview guide. Verbatim transcripts from the interviews were qualitatively analyzed following the recommendations discussed by Patton in Qualitative Research {\&} Evaluation Methods: Integrating Theory and Practice. After coding each interview, codes were formed into categories. Results: Overall, six categories were identified during the analysis process. They were as follows: “Something other than usual health care,” “Relevance and recognition,” “Flexible, understandable, and safe,” “Technical problems,” “Improvements by real-time contact,” and “Managing my life better.” One central and common pattern in the findings was that participants experienced the wCBT program as something they did themselves and many participants described the program as a form of self-care. Conclusions: Persons with heart failure and depressive symptoms described wCBT as challenging. This was due to participants balancing the urge for real-time contact with perceived anonymity and not postponing the work with the program. wCBT appears to be a valuable tool for managing depressive symptoms.},

ACT is unusual in that it is linked to a comprehensive active basic research program on the nature of human language and cognition (Relational Frame Theory), echoing back to an earlier era of behavior therapy in which clinical treatments were consciously based on basic behavioral principles. The evidence from correlational, component, process of change, and outcome comparisons relevant to the model are broadly supportive, but the literature is not mature and many questions have not yet been examined. What evidence is available suggests that ACT works through different processes than active treatment comparisons, including traditional Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT). There are not enough well-controlled studies to conclude that ACT is generally more effective than other active treatments across the range of problems examined, but so far the data are promising.},

The control condition is the principal method of removing the influence of unwanted variables in RCTs. There is little agreement or consistency in the design and construction of control conditions. Because control conditions have variable effects, the results of RCTs can depend as much on control condition selection as on the experimental intervention. The aim of this paper is to present a framework for the selection and design of control conditions for these trials. Threats to internal validity arising from modern RCT methodology are reviewed and reconsidered. The strengths and weaknesses of several categories of control conditions are examined, including the ones that are under experimental control, the ones that are under the control of clinical service providers, and no-treatment controls. Considerations in the selection of control conditions are discussed and several recommendations are proposed. The aim of this paper is to begin to define principles by which control conditions can be selected or developed in a manner that can assist both investigators and grant reviewers.

abstract = {Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) offers school counsellors a prac-tical and meaningful approach to helping students deal with a range of issues. This is achieved through encouraging psychological flexibility through the appli-cation of six key principles. This article describes our introduction to ACT, ACT's application to children and adolescents, and the creation and use of our ACT-based book for young people I Just Want To Be . . . Me!. Belinda, a Year 12 student had come to see me. She told me that she was struggling with her personal marijuana usage — she was smoking it before school most days and after school every day. She had been seeing the visiting Ted Noff's Drug and Alcohol counsellor regularly, and was able to reel off to me all the reasons why she should stop smoking it — but she hadn't. She sat back, apparently waiting for me to give her some more reasons why she should stop. Instead, I suggested to her that one of the things that affected our behaviour was the kind of things our mind says to us — the thoughts we have about ourselves. I shared with her that my mind sometimes beats me up, and says some pretty harsh things about me, and I wondered if she had the same experience. Oh yes, she said, she had horrible thoughts about herself. I asked would it be okay for her to tell me some of the mean things her mind sometimes said? She started listing a few — dumb, boring . . . Then she said 'Fat'. I noticed her face changed as she admitted to this one. And what does her mind say about that? What does that mean? Her eyes filled with tears. 'It means I'm ugly,' she said. 'And what does your mind say that means?' I asked. 'That no one will ever love me,' she said. And she burst into tears. When she had recovered, we went on to explore her thoughts some more, and found that she frequently compared herself to her friends, and judged that she came up short, especially as far as looks went. In fact, the only time she didn't think about it, the only time she felt all right about herself, was . . . when she was smoking pot.},

abstract = {Not only do anxiety and depression diagnoses tend to co-occur, but their symptoms are highly correlated. Although a plethora of research has examined longitudinal associations between anxiety and depression, these data have not yet been effectively synthesized. To address this need, the current study undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of 66 studies involving 88,336 persons examining the prospective relationship between anxiety and depression at both symptom and disorder levels. Using mixed-effect models, results suggested that all types of anxiety symptoms predicted later depressive symptoms (r ϭ .34), and all types of depressive symptoms predicted later anxiety symptoms (r ϭ .31). Although anxiety symptoms more strongly predicted depressive symptoms than vice versa, the difference in effect size for this analysis was very small and likely not clinically meaningful. Additionally, all types of diagnosed anxiety disorders predicted all types of later depressive disorders (OR ϭ 2.77), and all depressive disorders predicted later anxiety disorders (OR ϭ 2.73). Most anxiety and depressive disorders predicted each other with similar degrees of strength, but depressive disorders more strongly predicted social anxiety disorder (OR ϭ 6.05) and specific phobia (OR ϭ 2.93) than vice versa. Contrary to conclusions of prior reviews, our findings suggest that depressive disorders may be prodromes for social and specific phobia, whereas other anxiety and depressive disorders are bidirectional risk factors for one another. Public Significance Statement This meta-analysis suggests that anxiety and depression symptoms bidirectionally prospectively predict one another with moderate and similar strength. These prospective bidirectional relationships are stronger over shorter time periods and weaken over longer time periods. Most anxiety and depressive disorders significantly bidirectionally prospectively predicted one another with strong nonsignificantly different strength. However, depressive disorders more strongly predicted social and specific phobia than vice versa, suggesting that depressive disorders may be prodromes for social and specific phobia.},

The present study tested the effects of therapist-guided internet-delivered acceptance-based behaviour therapy on symptoms of GAD and quality of life. An audio CD with acceptance and mindfulness exercises and a separate workbook were also included in the treatment. Participants diagnosed with GAD (N ¼ 103) were randomly allocated to immediate therapist-guided internet-delivered acceptance-based behaviour therapy or to a waiting-list control condition. A six month follow-up was also included. Results using hierarchical linear modelling showed moderate to large effects on symptoms of GAD (Cohen's d ¼ 0.70 to 0.98), moderate effects on depressive symptoms (Cohen's d ¼ 0.51 to 0.56), and no effect on quality of life. Follow-up data showed maintained effects. While there was a 20{\%} dropout rate, sensitivity analyses showed that dropouts did not differ in their degree of change during treatment. To conclude, our study suggests that internet-delivered acceptance-based behaviour therapy can be effective in reducing the symptoms of GAD.},

abstract = {The first wave of behavior therapy countered the excesses and scientific weakness of existing nonempirical clinical traditions through empirically studied first-order change efforts linked to behavioral principles targeting directly relevant clinical tar-gets. The second wave was characterized by similar direct change efforts guided by social learning and cognitive principles that included cognitive in addition to behav-ioral and emotive targets. Various factors seem to have set the stage for a third wave, including anomalies in the current literature and philosophical changes. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is one of a number of new interventions from both behavioral and cognitive wings that seem to be moving the field in a different direc-tion. ACT is explicitly contextualistic and is based on a basic experimental analysis of human language and cognition, Relational Frame Theory (RFF). RFT explains why cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance are both ubiquitous and harmful. ACT targets these processes and is producing supportive data both at the process and outcome level. The third-wave treatments are characterized by openness to older clinical traditions, a focus on second order and contextual change, an emphasis of function over form, and the construction of flexible and effective repertoires, among other features. They build on the first-and second-wave treatments, but seem to be carrying the behavior therapy tradition forward into new territory. Over the last several years quite a number of behavior therapies have emerged that do not fit easily into traditional categories within the field.},

abstract = {A cognitive model of panic is described. Within this model panic attacks arc said to result from the catastrophic misinterpretation of certain bodily sensations. The sensations which are misinterpreted are mainly those involved in normal anxiety responses (e.g. palpitations, breathlessness. dizziness etc.) but also include some other sensations. The catastrophic misinterpretation involves perceiving these sensations as much more dangerous than they really are (e.g. perceiving palpitations as evidence of an impending heart attack). A review of the literature indicates that the proposed model is consistent with the major features of panic. In particular, it is consistent with the nature of the cognitive disturbance in panic patients, the perceived sequence of events in an attack, the occurrence of 'spontaneous' attacks, the role of hyperventilation in attacks, the effects of sodium lactate and the literature on psychological and pharmacological treatments. Finally, a series of direct tests of the model are proposed.},

Research consistently implicates safety behaviors in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders; accordingly, safety behaviors are traditionally eliminated during exposure treatments for pathological anxiety. The notion that safety behaviors are ubiquitously deleterious in the context of exposure has recently been challenged, yet findings regarding safety behaviors' effects on exposure outcomes are limited, mixed, and controversial. Furthermore, developments in explanatory models for exposure's effectiveness (e.g., inhibitory learning theory) highlight other possible consequences of safety behaviors performed during exposure. Unfortunately, these theoretical advances are neglected in experimental research. The present review critically examines the literature addressing the role of safety behaviors in exposure therapy from an inhibitory learning perspective. Limitations, future directions, and clinical recommendations are also discussed.},

Although mind-set specificity has been investigated for broad attributes such as personality and intelligence, less is known about mental health mind-sets (e.g., beliefs about anxiety) that have greater relevance to clinical science. In two studies, we took a latent variable approach to examine how different mind-sets (anxiety, social anxiety, depression, drinking tendencies, emotions, intelligence, and personality mind-sets) were related to one another and to psychological symptoms. Results provide evidence for both domain specificity (e.g., depression mind-set predicted depression symptoms) and generality (i.e., the anxiety mind-set and the general mind-set factor predicted most symptoms). These findings may help refine measurement of mental health mind-sets and suggest that beliefs about anxiety and beliefs about changeability in general are related to clinically relevant variables.},

In particular, therapist-guided Internet treatments have been found to be effective for a wide range of psychiatric and somatic conditions in well over 100 controlled trials. These treatments require (a) a secure web platform, (b) robust assessment procedures, (c) treatment contents that can be text based or offered in other formats, and (d) a therapist role that differs from that in face-to-face therapy. Studies suggest that guided Internet treatments can be as effective as face-to-face treatments, lead to sustained improvements, work in clinically representative conditions, and probably are cost-effective. Despite these research findings, Internet treatment is not yet disseminated in most places, and clinical psychologists should consider using modern information technology and evidence-based treatment programs as a complement to their other services, even though there will always be clients for whom face-to-face treatment is the best option.},

Assessments took place at pre-intervention, mid-intervention (mediators), post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up. Mixed effects modeling including all available data from all time points were used for the data analysis. Intervention effects on the reduction of binge rate were weaker for participants with higher baseline BMI and for participants with a lower baseline purge rate. Intervention effects on reduction of eating disorder pathology were weaker for participants with higher baseline purge rate and with initial restrictive eating. No moderators of the intervention effect on restrictive eating were identified. An increase in knowledge mediated the beneficial effect of SB+ on binge rate. The results suggest that different moderators should be considered for the reduction of symptoms and change in attitudes of disturbed eating and that SB+ at least partially operates through psychoeducation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heightened reactivity to unpredictable threat (U-threat) is a core individual difference factor underlying fear-based psychopathology. Little is known, however, about whether reactivity to U-threat is a stable marker of fear-based psychopathology or if it is malleable to treatment. The aim of the current study was to address this question by examining differences in reactivity to U-threat within patients before and after 12-weeks of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). METHODS: Participants included patients with principal fear (n = 22) and distress/misery disorders (n = 29), and a group of healthy controls (n = 21) assessed 12-weeks apart. A well-validated threat-of-shock task was used to probe reactivity to predictable (P-) and U-threat and startle eyeblink magnitude was recorded as an index of defensive responding. RESULTS: Across both assessments, individuals with fear-based disorders displayed greater startle magnitude to U-threat relative to healthy controls and distress/misery patients (who did not differ). From pre- to post-treatment, startle magnitude during U-threat decreased only within the fear patients who received CBT. Moreover, within fear patients, the magnitude of decline in startle to U-threat correlated with the magnitude of decline in fear symptoms. For the healthy controls, startle to U-threat across the two time points was highly reliable and stable. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results indicate that startle to U-threat characterizes fear disorder patients and is malleable to treatment with CBT but not SSRIs within fear patients. Startle to U-threat may therefore reflect an objective, psychophysiological indicator of fear disorder status and CBT treatment response.},

abstract = {Background and objectives: Traditional models and methods of exposure therapy utilize a fear hierarchy, whereby patients complete sets of exposures in a graduated manner, with the goal of fear habituation within and between sessions. In the current experiment, we examined whether this typical exposure paradigm was necessary to achieve clinical improvement. Method: Fifty undergraduate participants scoring in the top quartile of a self-report measure of contamination fears were randomly assigned to one of two groups: blocked and constant exposure (BC Group) and random and variable exposure (RV Group). Both groups completed three weekly sessions of exposure treatment, with subjective and psychophysiological indices of fear recorded throughout. Subjective, behavioral, and psychophysiological dependent measures were evaluated by an independent assessor at pre-treatment (PRE), post-treatment (POST), and two-week follow-up (2WFU). Results: Both the BC Group and RV Group exhibited decreases in subjective fear from PRE to POST and 2WFU, with no significant differences between groups. Partialing group, greater variability in subjective fear during exposure predicted lower subjective fear at 2WFU. Limitations: Despite significant findings for subjective fear, behavioral and psychophysiological findings were limited. Follow-up studies should investigate questions regarding traditional exposure within a clinical group. Conclusions: These results support the notion that traditional exposure is sufficient, but not necessary, to produce clinical improvement in contamination-related fears. There may be benefits to variability in fear level during exposure, and evaluation of emotion variability during exposure therapy for other anxiety disorders is warranted. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Internet-based psychotherapeutic interventions have been used for more than a decade, but no comprehensive review and no extensive meta-analysis of their effectiveness have been conducted. We have collected all of the empirical articles published up to March 2006 (n=64) that examine the effectiveness of online therapy of different forms and performed a meta-analysis of all the studies reported in them (n=92). These studies involved a total of 9,764 clients who were treated through various Internet-based psychological interventions for a variety of problems, whose effectiveness was assessed by different types of measures. The overall mean weighted effect size was found to be 0.53 (medium effect), which is quite similar to the average effect size of traditional, face-to-face therapy. Next, we examined interacting effects of various possible relevant moderators of the effects of online therapy, including type of therapy (self-help web-based therapy versus online communication-based etherapy), type of outcome measure, time of measurement of outcome (post-therapy or follow-up), type of problem treated, therapeutic approach, and communication modality, among others. A comparison between face-to-face and Internet intervention as reported on in 14 of the studies revealed no differences in effectiveness. The findings of this meta-analysis, and review of additional Internet therapy studies not included in the meta-analysis, provide strong support for the adoption of online psychological interventions as a legitimate therapeutic activity and suggest several insights in regard to its application. Limitations of the findings and recommendations concerning Internet-based therapy and future research are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The Haworth Press. All rights reserved.},

The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to isolate and define the subconstructs of assertiveness as they emerged from the structure of two assertive inventories—the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule and the College Self Expression Scale; (2) to evaluate assertiveness as a communication construct by examining it in the framework of two measures of communicator style—a Communicator Style Measure and a test of Predispositions toward Verbal Behavior. Results revealed that the assertiveness measures related to the expected subconstructs of communicator style. Assertiveness, as evidenced by low anxiety, dominance, contentiousness, and a refusal to be intimidated by others, correlated highly with measures of verbal intensity, talkativeness, and good communicator style.

Affect phobia therapy (APT) is a name given to McCullough's STDP to highlight the main treatment focus and to guide therapists to the most efficient and effective interventions. This treat- ment model is based on the hypothesis that conflicts about feelings, or “affect phobias,” are the fundamen- tal issues underlying many Axis I and Axis II disorders. Systematic desensitization, or stepwise exposure to feelings and defense response prevention, is hypothe- sized to be the fundamental agent of therapeutic change. APT focuses primarily on the resolution of af- fective conflicts in a psychodynamic framework, but videotape review and process studies of this STDP model have discovered that interventions from cogni- tive, behavior, Gestalt, and experiential therapy, as well as self-psychology, have been instrumental in patient change. Therapy is made briefer by clarifying treatment objectives, simplifying the selection criteria, and using principles of systematic desensitization for the resolu- tion of affect phobias.},

The PEO network was produced by acid-catlayzed self-condensation of $\alpha$,$\omega$-bis(triethoxysilane)-terminated PEO in the presence of small amounts of water. The PMMA network was formed by free radical polymerization of MAA in the presence of divinylbenzene as crosslinker. The reaction conditions were adjusted to obtain similar crosslinking kinetics for both reactions. An attempt was made to construct a phase diagram of the IPNs by measuring the composition of the IPNs at the moment of the appearance of the phase separation, as indicated by the onset of turbidity. This composition could be determined because the siloxane crosslinks of the PEO network could be hydrolyzed in aqueous NaOH with the formation of linear, soluble PEO chains. The phase diagram was compared with phase diagrams of blends of linear polymers and of semi-IPNs (crosslinked PMMA and linear PEO), obtained under similar conditions, i.e. polymerization of MMA in the presence of varying amounts of PEO. It was observed that the form of the phase diagrams of the linear polymers is similar to that of the IPNs, but is quite different from that of the semi-IPNs. Thus, homogeneous transparent materials containing up to 60{\%} of PEO could be prepared in the blends and the IPNs, but in the semi-IPNs, phase separation occurred with PEO contents as low as 10{\%}.},

LFB, 0000-0003-4478-2051 In this paper, we integrate recent theoretical and empirical developments in predictive coding and active inference accounts of interoception (including the Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding model) with working hypoth-eses from the theory of constructed emotion to propose a biologically plausible unified theory of the mind that places metabolism and energy regulation (i.e. allostasis), as well as the sensory consequences of that regulation (i.e. inter-oception), at its core. We then consider the implications of this approach for understanding depression. We speculate that depression is a disorder of allos-tasis, whose myriad symptoms result from a 'locked in' brain that is relatively insensitive to its sensory context. We conclude with a brief discussion of the ways our approach might reveal new insights for the treatment of depression.

Hence, little is known about the relative efficacy of ICBT as compared to face-to-face cognitive behavior therapy (CBT).

Out of the 2078 articles screened, a total of 20 studies met all inclusion criteria. Results showed a pooled effect size at post-treatment of Hedges g =.05 (95{\%} CI, −.09 to.20), indicating that ICBT and face-to-face treatment produced equivalent overall effects. Study quality did not affect outcomes. While the overall results indicate equivalence, there have been few studies of the individual psychiatric and somatic conditions so far, and for the majority, guided ICBT has not been compared against face-to-face treatment. Thus, more research, preferably with larger sample sizes, is needed to establish the general equivalence of the two treatment formats.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {\textgreater} or =10 had a sensitivity of 88{\%} and a specificity of 88{\%} for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

Objective: Review evidence that computerized CBT for the anxiety and depressive disorders is acceptable to patients and effective in the short and longer term. Method: Systematic reviews and data bases were searched for randomized controlled trials of computerized cognitive behavior therapy versus a treatment or control condition in people who met diagnostic criteria for major depression, panic disorder, social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder. Number randomized, superiority of treatment versus control (Hedges g) on primary outcome measure, risk of bias, length of follow up, patient adherence and satisfaction were extracted. Principal Findings: 22 studies of comparisons with a control group were identified. The mean effect size superiority was 0.88 (NNT 2.13), and the benefit was evident across all four disorders. Improvement from computerized CBT was maintained for a median of 26 weeks follow-up. Acceptability, as indicated by adherence and satisfaction, was good. Research probity was good and bias risk low. Effect sizes were non-significantly higher in comparisons with waitlist than with active treatment control conditions. Five studies comparing computerized CBT with traditional face-to-face CBT were identified, and both modes of treatment appeared equally beneficial. Conclusions: Computerized CBT for anxiety and depressive disorders, especially via the internet, has the capacity to provide effective acceptable and practical health care for those who might otherwise remain untreated. {\textcopyright} 2010 Andrews et al.},

abstract = {A 30-item schedule for measuring assertiveness is presented. The scheduleis shown to have moderate to high test-restest reliability (r=.78; p{\textless}.01) and split-half reliability (r=.77; p{\textless}.01). Validity in terms of the impressions respondents make on other people (.33≤r′s≤.62; p′s{\textless}.01) and in terms of their indications of how they would behave in specific situations in which assertive, outgoing behavior can be used with profit (r=.70; p{\textless}.01) is satisfactory. Item analysis shows that 27 of the 30 items correlate significantly with the total scale score and 19 of 30 correlate significantly with external criteria. Considerations regarding the usage of a shorter version of the scale are discussed, as are the implications of the finding that assertiveness covaries negatively with impressions of respondents' niceness. {\textcopyright} 1973 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Anxiety disorders are a highly prevalent cause of impairment globally with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) sharing many features with other anxiety disorders. Aims: The present study investigated the helpful and hindering events and impacts for individuals with generalized anxiety who engaged with a supported 6-week online intervention based on cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT). Method: Participants (n = 36) completed the Helpful and Hindering Aspects of Therapy (HAT) for each session. A descriptive-interpretative framework was used to analyse the data. Results: Helpful events were identified by participants as CBT techniques including psychoeducation, monitoring, cognitive restructuring and relaxation, and found supporter interaction, mindfulness and reading personal stories helpful. The associated impacts were identified as support and validation; behavioural change/applying coping strategies; clarification, awareness, and insight; reassurance/relief; and self-efficacy/empowerment. Hindering events were identified as treatment content/form; and amount of work/technical issues, which led to impacts such as frustration/irritation; increased anxiety; and isolation. Conclusion: The implications of the results, potential future directions of research and limitations of the study are discussed.},

However, to make valid comparisons it is necessary to assure the equivalence of measurement instruments across populations. In this paper we use multidimensional scaling (MDS) to evaluate the structural equivalence of a measure of assertiveness developed originally for Mexican culture across Mexican and Spanish samples. 316 students from the Autonomous University of Yucatan (Mexico) and 316 students from the University of Granada (Spain) responded to the questionnaire. Separate dimensions were needed to account for the structure of the assertiveness questionnaire across the Mexican and Spanish samples. However, the distinction between dimensions was different in both samples. The results suggest that culture determines which assertive behaviors are considered appropriate. The usefulness of MDS for evaluating the equivalence of psychological questionnaires is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 SAGE Publications.},

abstract = {The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDIII) are frequently used measures of depression severity, but little is known about their relative psychometric properties. The authors assessed psychometric properties of both measures during treatment for depression. The PHQ-9 and BDI-II scores from 172 depressed participants in two randomized controlled trials of treatment for depression were assessed and combined. Tests of internal consistency (Cronbach's a), factor analyses, correlational analyses, estimates of clinically significant change, and effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated after treatment and follow-up. Both scales demonstrated adequate internal consistency at pre- and posttreatment (PHQ-9 $\alpha$ = .74 and .81; BDI-II a = .87 and .90, respectively). Factor analysis failed to confirm the one-factor model previously reported for the PHQ-9, but two factors evidenced good fit for the BDI-II. Both scales converged more with each other than with the Sheehan Disability Scale at pre- but not at posttreatment. Responsiveness to change of PHQ-9 and BDI-II was similar at both posttreatment and follow-up. The consistency of agreement on indices of clinical significance was fair to moderate, but the BDI-II categorised a greater proportion of participants with severe depression than the PHQ-9. The BDI-II and PHQ-9 demonstrated adequate reliability, convergent/discriminant validity, and similar responsiveness to change. Differences were found in how they categorised severity. Pending the results of further studies, the attributes of the PHQ-9, of being shorter and based on the diagnostic criteria for depression, may indicate an advantage over the BDI-II. {\textcopyright} 2011 Swedish Association for Behaviour Therapy.},

abstract = {Humans possess great capacity for behavioral and cultural change, but our ability to manage change is still limited. This article has two major objectives: first, to sketch a basic science of intentional change centered on evolution; second, to provide examples of intentional behavioral and cultural change from the applied behavioral sciences, which are largely unknown to the basic sciences community. All species have evolved mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity that enable them to respond adaptively to their environments. Some mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity count as evolutionary processes in their own right. The human capacity for symbolic thought provides an inheritance system having the same kind of combinatorial diversity as does genetic recombination and antibody formation. Taking these propositions seriously allows an integration of major traditions within the basic behavioral sciences, such as behaviorism, social constructivism, social psychology, cognitive psychology, and evolutionary psychology, which are often isolated and even conceptualized as opposed to one another. The applied behavioral sciences include well-validated examples of successfully managing behavioral and cultural change at scales ranging from individuals to small groups to large populations. However, these examples are largely unknown beyond their disciplinary boundaries, for lack of a unifying theoretical framework. Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, they are examples of managing evolved mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity, including open-ended processes of variation and selection. Once the many branches of the basic and applied behavioral sciences become conceptually unified, we are closer to a science of intentional change than one might think.},

abstract = {Growth models (also known as linear mixed effects models, multilevel models, and random coefficients models) have the capability of studying change at the group as well as the individual level. In addition, these methods have documented advantages over traditional data analytic approaches in the analysis of repeated-measures data. These advantages include, but are not limited to, the ability to incorporate time-varying predictors, handle dependence among repeated observations in a very flexible manner, and to provide accurate estimates with missing data under fairly unrestrictive missing data assumptions. The flexibility of the growth curve modeling approach to the analysis of change makes it the preferred choice in the evaluation of direct, indirect and moderated intervention effects. Although offering many benefits, growth models present challenges in terms of design, analysis and reporting of results. This paper provides a nontechnical overview of growth models in the analysis of change in randomized experiments and advocates for their use in the field of internet interventions. Practical recommendations for design, analysis and reporting of results from growth models are provided.},

However, research investigating different treatment interventions is scarce, and no randomized controlled trial has examined the efficacy of cognitivea 'behavior therapy (CBT). Meanwhile, Internet-based CBT has been found promising for several conditions, but has not yet been used for procrastination. Method: Participants (N = 150) were randomized to guided self-help, unguided self-help, and wait-list control.

@article{Dweck1995,
abstract = {In this target article, we present evidence for a new model of individual differences in judgments and reactions. The model holds that people's implicit theories about human attributes structure the way they understand and react to human actions and outcomes. We review research showing that when people believe that attributes (such as intelligence or moral character) are fixed, trait-like entities (an entity theory), they tend to understand outcomes and actions in terms of these fixed traits (“I failed the test because I am dumb” or “He stole the bread because he is dishonest”). In contrast, when people believe that attributes are more dynamic, malleable, and developable (an incremental theory), they tend to focus less on broad traits and, instead, tend to understand outcomes and actions in terms of more specific behavioral or psychological mediators (“I failed the test because of my effort or strategy” or “He stole the bread because he was desperate”). The two frameworks also appear to foster different reactions: helpless versus mastery-oriented responses to personal setbacks and an emphasis on retribution versus education or rehabilitation for transgressions. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for personality, motivation, and social perception. {\textcopyright} 1995, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Individuals avoid stimuli which are associated with aversive experience to preserve safety. However, behavioral avoidance also causes impairments and prevents the individual from attaining positive rewards. Little is known about the link between fear acquisition and the development of behavioral avoidance in the presence of potential rewards. Therefore, two experiments investigated the impact of fear conditioning on a subsequent gambling task. In an experimental group (n = 30) advantageous choices (higher reward probability) were linked to a fear-relevant stimulus that was associated with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) during fear conditioning (conditioned stimulus, CS+). A disadvantageous choice (lower reward probability) was, however, linked to a safe stimulus that was never associated with the US (CS-). In a control group (n = 25), fear conditioning was followed by a similar gambling task with novel stimuli. A second experiment focused on individual predictors of avoidant decisions (n = 81). Compared with the control group, individuals in the experimental groups avoided the advantageous CS + choice despite fewer gains. The predictor analysis further clarified that avoidant decisions were pronounced in highly trait anxious participants who exhibited higher fear responses. On the other hand, findings also indicated a reduction in absolute avoidance across the task. Combined, these findings demonstrate that fear conditioning can lead to avoidant decision making, especially in vulnerable individuals. The resulting costs parallel impairments caused by behavioral avoidance. Such an emotional decision-making style may be a link between aversive experience and the development of habitual pathological avoidance. Introducing rewards for approach, however, may counteract avoidant decisions.},

abstract = {This work begins by proposing the need for exploring the mode of being of mental disorders. It is a philosophical study in an Aristotelian perspective, with special emphasis on the anthropological–cultural dimension. It is difficult for such an inquiry to be car- ried out from within psychiatry or clinical psychology, committed as these fields are to their own logic and practical conditions. The issues are, in any case, more ontological than strictly clinical in nature. We there- fore turn to Aristotle, and specifically his doctrine of the four “causes,” to flesh out the social and cultural dimensions of mental disorders. In accordance with the present analysis, the material cause of disorders would be found in the contingencies of life; the formal cause would pertain primarily to the way clinical conditions themselves can serve as models of ‘being ill' in our society; the efficient cause would correspond to the pa- tients themselves, understood as active (albeit less than fully conscious) agents as well as to the pharmaceutical industry and the mass media; the final cause would be found in different adaptive functions served by the dis- order. We conclude that the “mode of being” of most (if not all) mental disorders—in particular, their status as mental disorders—can often have more to do with cultural forms than with biological factors.},

Results: ACT outperformed control conditions (Hedges' g = 0.57) at posttreatment and follow-up assessments in completer and intent-to-treat analyses for primary outcomes. ACT was superior to waitlist (Hedges' g = 0.82), to psychological placebo (Hedges' g = 0.51) and to treatment as usual (TAU) (we defined TAU as the standard treatment as usual; Hedges' g = 0.64). ACT was also superior on secondary outcomes (Hedges' g = 0.30), life satisfaction/quality measures (Hedges' g = 0.37) and process measures (Hedges' g = 0. 56) compared to control conditions. The comparison between ACT and established treatments (cognitive behavioral therapy) did not reveal any significant differences between these treatments (p = 0.140). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that ACT is more effective than treatment as usual or placebo and that ACT may be as effective in treating anxiety disorders, depression, addiction, and somatic health problems as established psychological interventions. More research that focuses on quality of life and processes of change is needed to understand the added value of ACT and its transdiagnostic nature.},

abstract = {Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) refers to a popular therapeutic approach that has been applied to a variety of problems. The goal of this review was to provide a comprehensive survey of meta-analyses examining the efficacy of CBT. We identified 269 meta-analytic studies and reviewed of those a representative sample of 106 metaanalyses examining CBT for the following problems: substance use disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, depression and dysthymia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, eating disorders, insomnia, personality disorders, anger and aggression, criminal behaviors, general stress, distress due to general medical conditions, chronic pain and fatigue, distress related to pregnancy complications and female hormonal conditions. Additional meta-analytic reviews examined the efficacy of CBT for various problems in children and elderly adults. The strongest support exists for CBT of anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, bulimia, anger control problems, and general stress. Eleven studies compared response rates between CBT and other treatments or control conditions. CBT showed higher response rates than the comparison conditions in seven of these reviews and only one review reported that CBT had lower response rates than comparison treatments. In general, the evidencebase of CBT is very strong. However, additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of CBT for randomizedcontrolled studies. Moreover, except for children and elderly populations, no meta-analytic studies of CBT have been reported on specific subgroups, such as ethnic minorities and low income samples. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

abstract = {Given that countless studies have documented the wide-ranging benefits of self-regulation, determining if and how self-regulation can be improved is an important scientific and societal priority. Existing theories suggest that the deterioration of self-regulation is partially shaped by perceptions of effort. Therefore, one promising way to sustain self-regulation may be to cultivate a growth mindset, which has been shown to affect behavior in part by altering effort attributions. Although growth mindsets—the belief that a given trait can be improved through practice—have been studied extensively, particularly in the domain of intelligence, little research has examined the effects of promoting a growth mindset specifically about self-regulation. Here five studies test how promoting a growth mindset of self-regulation impacts actual self-regulation in daily life and the laboratory. In Study 1, relative to an active control that received relationship training, an intensive self-regulation training program emphasizing a growth mindset led participants to persevere longer on impossible anagrams, which was partially mediated by altering attributions of mental fatigue. Relatively, the self-regulation training also led participants to notice more opportunities for self-control in daily life and more successfully resist everyday temptations. The subsequent four studies isolated and abbreviated the growth mindset manipulation, demonstrated improved persistence and decreased effort avoidance, and attempted to further examine the critical mediators. Collectively, results indicate that a growth mindset of self-regulation can change attributions and allocation of effort in meaningful ways that may affect the willingness to attempt challenging tasks and the perseverance required to complete them.},

abstract = {Although several self-report inventories of assertive behaviors are available for clinical and research use, normative data currently available on these measures provide only a gross index with regard to an individual's assertiveness relative to others in his social milieu. A study was conducted to develop more specific normative data for the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule (RAS). The RAS was administered to 133 undergraduates, and percentile norms were developed from the obtained distribution of total scores. In addition, derived scores were calculated from Z score norms developed for each item. The percentile norms provide information on an individual's overall assertiveness relative to others in his social milieu, while the item norms provide information as to relative assertiveness in specific target situations. It is suggested that the percentile norms might prove most useful in research with groups for which only a gross index of relative assertiveness is required. Normative data for the items of the RAS should be clinically useful, not only to pinpoint areas of deficit assertive behavior, but also to assess behavior change after therapeutic intervention. The need for additional research is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of iCBT compared to inactive (waitlist control and treatment-as-usual (TAU)) and active other interventions in reducing PTSD symptoms. Methods: A meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials (14 comparisons) and 1,306 participants was conducted. Results: The pooled effect size of the 11 comparisons (10 studies, 1,139 participants) that compared iCBT to waitlist and TAU control was moderate (g = 0.71, 95{\%} CI [0.49–0.93], P {\textless}.001), and showed moderate heterogeneity. The pooled effect size of the three studies (three comparisons) comparing iCBT to other interventions was small (g = 0.28, 95{\%} CI [−0.00 to 0.56], P =.05), with low heterogeneity. Conclusion: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis show that iCBT is an effective treatment for individuals with PTSD and comorbid depressive symptoms. However, further research is needed for effective dissemination of iCBT in clinical practice.},

Although many assertiveness instruments have been developed for research and clinical purposes, one common shortcoming is a lack of discriminant validity with regard to aggression. Further, the wording of many instruments is outdated and discriminatory. The goal of the present research was to develop a more sensitive instrument measuring two distinguishable forms of assertiveness: adaptive assertiveness and aggressive assertiveness. We present data validating such a measure, the Adaptive and Aggressive Assertiveness Scales (AAA-S). Participants included two samples of college students and a clinical sample of adults with anxiety disorders. The AAA-S demonstrated good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The aggressive assertiveness scale was associated with various forms of aggression and peer reports of aggressive assertiveness. The adaptive assertiveness scale was associated with competence and peer reports of adaptive assertiveness. Importantly, there were no gender differences in adaptive assertiveness.

Within the context of a randomized controlled trial of CBT, this study examined patients' beliefs about the fixed versus malleable nature of anxiety-their 'implicit theories'-as a key variable in CBT for SAD. Compared to waitlist (n ¼ 29; 58{\%} female), CBT (n ¼ 24; 52{\%} female) led to significantly lower levels of fixed beliefs about anxiety (M baseline ¼ 11.70 vs. M Post ¼ 7.08, d ¼ 1.27). These implicit beliefs indirectly explained CBT-related changes in social anxiety symptoms (k 2 ¼ .28, [95{\%} CI ¼ 0.12, 0.46]). Implicit beliefs also uniquely predicted treatment outcomes when controlling for baseline social anxiety and other kinds of maladaptive beliefs (perceived social costs, perceived social self-efficacy, and maladaptive interpersonal beliefs). Finally, implicit beliefs continued to predict social anxiety symptoms at 12 months post-treatment. These findings suggest that changes in patients' beliefs about their emotions may play an important role in CBT for SAD.},

Compared to controls, both social phobics and patients with an avoidant personality disorder had significantly lower mean scores on all performance scales and significantly higher ones on all distress scales, with the social phobics occupying a position in between. Findings in relation to convergent and divergent validity were quite satisfactory.

In this study we examined whether anxiety mindset would moderate relations between history of stressful life events and psychological distress and coping. Consistent with predictions, relations between number of stressful life events and posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression, substance use, and motivations for non-suicidal self-injury were weaker among those with more of a growth mindset relative to those with more of a fixed mindset. These initial results suggest that anxiety mindsets function in a similar way for mental health resilience as how mindsets of intelligence function for academic outcomes.},

abstract = {Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of being scrutinized by others in social situations. It is highly prevalent and follows a chronic course for many affected if untreated. Treatment with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be highly effective for SAD with responder rates of 50-75 {\%}. For more than a decade, Internet-based CBT (ICBT) has been researched and evidence has been provided by four independent research groups. In essence, most forms of ICBT for SAD can generally be described as therapist-guided Internet-based self-help CBT where a named therapist guides the client through the treatment. The treatments are manualized and highly structured comprising 5-15 modules or lessons, which are the equivalent of sessions in face-to-face CBT. The existing treatments for SAD all have vital features in common including that they are based in CBT, comprise the same interventions as have been shown to be effective in face-to-face CBT, have large amount of psychoeducational material, and use asynchronous text messages as the main communication between patient and therapist. ICBT for SAD has been proven to be effective in at least 16 randomized trials and found to be non-inferior to face-to-face CBT. A few studies suggest that ICBT is a cost-effective treatment. Since SAD is known to appear at an early age in most cases, one central future challenge is to increase the body of knowledge on ICBT for children and adolescents. For adults, ICBT for SAD is clearly an effective treatment and a promising option for increasing accessibility to evidence-based psychological treatment.

Meanwhile, Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) has shown promising results for many psychiatric disorders. However, research on the potential for negative effects of psychological treatments has been lacking. Method: An individual patient data meta-analysis of 29 clinical trials of ICBT (N = 2,866) was performed using the Reliable Change Index for each primary outcome measures to distinguish deterioration rates among patients in treatment and control conditions. Statistical analyses of predictors were conducted using generalized linear mixed models. Missing data was handled by multiple imputation. Results: Deterioration rates were 122 (5.8{\%}) in treatment and 130 (17.4{\%}) in control conditions. Relative to receiving treatment, patients in a control condition had higher odds of deteriorating, odds ratios (ORs) = 3.10, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) [2.21, 4.34]. Clinical severity at pretreatment was related to lower odds, OR = 0.62, 95{\%} CI [0.50, 0.77], and OR = 0.51, 95{\%} CI [0.51, 0.80], for treatment and control conditions.

Conclusion: Deterioration among patients receiving ICBT or being in a control condition can occur and should be monitored by researchers to reverse and prevent a negative treatment trend.},

abstract = {Background: The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) is a practical self-report anxiety questionnaire that proved valid in primary care. However, the GAD-7 was not yet validated in the general population and thus far, normative data are not available. Objectives: To investigate reliability, construct validity, and facto-rial validity of the GAD-7 in the general population and to generate normative data. Research Design: Nationally representative face-to-face household survey conducted in Germany between May 5 and June 8, 2006. Subjects: Five thousand thirty subjects (53.6{\%} female) with a mean age (SD) of 48.4 (18.0) years. Measures: The survey questionnaire included the GAD-7, the 2-item depression module from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and demographic char-acteristics. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses substantiated the 1-dimen-sional structure of the GAD-7 and its factorial invariance for gender and age. Internal consistency was identical across all subgroups (␣ ϭ 0.89). Intercorrelations with the PHQ-2 and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale were r ϭ 0.64 (P Ͻ 0.001) and r ϭ Ϫ0.43 (P Ͻ 0.001), respectively. As expected, women had significantly higher mean (SD) GAD-7 anxiety scores compared with men ͓3.2 (3.5) vs. 2.7 (3.2); P Ͻ 0.001͔. Normative data for the GAD-7 were generated for both genders and different age levels. Approximately 5{\%} of subjects had GAD-7 scores of 10 or greater, and 1{\%} had GAD-7 scores of 15 or greater. Conclusions: Evidence supports reliability and validity of the GAD-7 as a measure of anxiety in the general population. The normative data provided in this study can be used to compare a subject's GAD-7 score with those determined from a general pop-ulation reference group.},

abstract = {Learning theory provides a foundation for understanding and deriving treatment principles for impacting a spectrum of functional processes relevant to the construct of depression. While behavioral interventions have been commonplace in the cognitive behavioral tradition, most often conceptualized within a cognitive theoretical framework, recent years have seen renewed interest in more purely behavioral models. These modern learning theory accounts of depression focus on the interchange between behavior and the environment, mainly in terms of lack of reinforcement, extinction of instrumental behavior, and excesses of aversive control, and include a conceptualization of relevant cognitive and emotional variables. These positions, drawn from extensive basic and applied research, cohere with biological theories on reduced reward learning and reward responsiveness and views of depression as a heterogeneous, complex set of disorders. Treatment techniques based on learning theory, often labeled Behavioral Activation (BA) focus on activating the individual in directions that increase contact with potential reinforcers, as defined ideographically with the client. BA is considered an empirically well-established treatment that generalizes well across diverse contexts and populations. The learning theory account is discussed in terms of being a parsimonious model and ground for treatments highly suitable for large scale dissemination.},

abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (CCBT) for the treatment of anxiety, depression, phobias, panic and obsessive–compulsive behaviour (OCD). The software packages to be considered include Beating the Blues (BtB), Overcoming Depression: a five areas approach, FearFighter (FF), Cope and BT Steps. Other packages or programmes incorporating CCBT were also considered. Data sources: Electronic databases from 1966 to March 2004. Evidence submitted by sponsors for CCBT products Review methods: A systematic review was performed to identify all studies describing trials of CCBT. The costeffectiveness assessment included a review of the literature and the evidence submitted by sponsors for each of the products. A series of cost-effectiveness models was developed and run by the project team for the five CCBT products across the three mental health conditions. Results: Twenty studies were identified in the clinical effectiveness review. The analysis of these results showed some evidence that CCBT is as effective as therapist-led cognitive behaviour therapy (TCBT) for the treatment of depression/anxiety and phobia/panic and is more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) in the treatment of depression/anxiety. CCBT also appears to reduce therapist time compared with TCBT. When reviewing cost-effectiveness studies, only one published economic evaluation of CCBT was found. This was an economic evaluation of the depression software BtB alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT), which found that BtB was cost-effective against TAU in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (less than {\pounds}2000), however it contained weaknesses that were then addressed in the costeffectiveness model developed for the study. The results of the model for the depression software packages in terms of incremental cost per QALY compared with TAU and the chance of being costeffective at {\pounds}30,000 per QALY were for BtB {\pounds}1801 and 86.8{\%}, for Cope {\pounds}7139 and 62.6{\%} and for Overcoming Depression {\pounds}5391 and 54.4{\%}. The strength of the BtB software being that it has been evaluated in the context of an RCT with a control group. The subgroup analysis found no differences across the severity groupings. For phobia/panic software, the model showed an incremental cost per QALY of FF over relaxation was {\pounds}2380. Its position compared with TCBT is less clear. When modelling OCD packages, using the practice-level licence cost meant that BT Steps was dominated by TCBT, which had significantly better outcomes and was cheaper. However, the cheaper PCT licence resulted in the incremental cost-effectiveness of BT Steps over relaxation being {\pounds}15,581 and TCBT over BT Steps being {\pounds}22,484. Conclusions: The study findings are subject to substantial uncertainties around the organisational level for purchasing these products and the likely throughput. This is in addition to concerns with the quality of evidence on response to therapy, longer term outcomes and quality of life. The position of CCBT within a stepped care programme needs to be identified, as well as its relationship to other efforts to increase access to CBT and psychological therapies. Research is needed to compare CCBT with other therapies that reduce therapist time, in particular bibliotherapy and to explore the use of CCBT via the Internet. Independent research is needed, particularly RCTs, that examine areas such as patient preference and therapist involvement within primary care.},

abstract = {Internet-based self-help for social phobia with minimal therapist support via email have shown efficacy in several controlled trials by independent research teams. The role and necessity of therapist guidance is, however, still largely unclear. The present study compared the benefits of a 10-week web-based unguided self-help treatment for social phobia with the same intervention complemented with minimal, although weekly, therapist support via email. Further, a third treatment arm was included, in which the level of support was flexibly stepped up, from no support to email or telephone contact, on demand of the participants. Eighty-one individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for social phobia were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. Primary outcome measures were self-report measures of symptoms of social phobia. Secondary outcome measures included symptoms of depression, interpersonal problems, and general symptomatology. Measures were taken at baseline, post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up. Data from a telephone-administered diagnostic interview conducted at post-treatment were also included. Results showed significant symptom reductions in all three treatment groups with large effect sizes for primary social phobia measures (Cohen's d = 1.47) and for secondary outcome measures (d = 1.16). No substantial and significant between-groups effects were found on any of the measures (Cohen's d = 00-36). Moreover, no difference between the three conditions was found regarding diagnosis-free status, clinically significant change, dropout rates, or adherence measures such as lessons or exercises completed. These findings indicate that Internet-delivered treatment for social phobia is a promising treatment option, whether no support is provided or with two different types of therapist guidance. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

This is a complete novel approach, B{\&}eacute;zier curves being previously used mainly for computer graphics. The I-V characteristic is divided into three sections, modeled with lines and a quadratic B{\&}eacute;zier curve in the first case and with three cubic B{\&}eacute;zier curves in the second case. The result proves to be accurate and relies on the fundamental points usually present in the PV cell datasheets: V o c (the open circuit voltage), I s c (the short circuit current), V m p (the maximum power corresponding voltage) and I m p (the maximum power corresponding current), and the parasitic resistances R s h 0 (shunt resistance at I s c ) and R s 0 (series resistance at V o c ). The proposed algorithm completely defines all the implied control points and the error is analyzed. The temperature and irradiance influence is also analyzed. The model is also compared using the least squares fitting method. The final validation shows how to use B{\&}eacute;zier cubic curves to accurately represent the I-V curves of an extensive range of PV cells and arrays.},

I make six recommendations that I believe will be of help going forward: focusing on theory and basic principles; embracing transdiagnostic thinking even more strongly; abandoning syndromal classification once and for all; creating a functional diagnostic system with treatment utility; integrating biology into behavioral science by aligning with modern multidimensional, multilevel evolution science; and becoming more serious about delivery systems. The future of CBT could be exciting if we are able to adjust to changing conditions in a flexible way.},

Those who believe their attributes are fixed view setbacks as threatening and avoid challenging situations. In contrast, those who believe these attributes are malleable embrace challenges as opportunities to grow. Although implicit theories would seem to have important mental health implications, the research linking them with clinical applications is limited. To address this gap, we assessed how implicit theories of anxiety, emotion, intelligence, and personality related to various symptoms of anxiety and depression, emotion-regulation strategies, and hypothetical treatment choices (e.g., medication versus therapy) in two undergraduate samples. Across both samples, individuals who believed their attributes could change reported fewer mental health symptoms, greater use of cognitive reappraisal, and were more likely to choose individual therapy over medication. These findings suggest that implicit theories may play an important role in the nature and treatment of mental health problems.},

abstract = {Background: A 2010 meta-analysis of internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) RCTs argued ‘computer therapy for the anxiety and depressive disorders was effective, acceptable and practical health care' without data on effectiveness or practicality in routine practice. Methods: Databases, reviews and meta-analyses were searched for randomised controlled trials of cCBT or iCBT versus a control group (care as usual, waitlist, information control, psychological placebo, pill placebo, etc.) in people who met diagnostic criteria for major depression, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder or generalised anxiety disorder. Number randomised, superiority of treatment versus control (Hedges'g) on primary outcome measure, length of follow-up, follow up outcome, patient adherence and satisfaction/harm were extracted; risk of bias was assessed. A search for studies on effectiveness of iCBT in clinical practice was conducted. Results: 64 trials were identified. The mean effect size (efficacy) was g = 0.80 (NNT 2.34), and benefit was evident across all four disorders. Improvement was maintained at follow-with good acceptability. Research probity was good, and bias risk low. In addition, nine studies comparing iCBT with traditional face-to-face CBT and three comparing iCBT with bibliotherapy were identified. All three modes of treatment delivery appeared equally beneficial. The results of effectiveness studies were congruent with the results of the efficacy trials. Limitations: Studies variably measured changes in quality of life and disability, and the lack of comparisons with medications weakens the field. Conclusions: The conclusions drawn in the original meta-analysis are now supported: iCBT for the anxiety and depressive disorders is effective, acceptable and practical health care.},

(a) The fear module is preferentially activated in aversive contexts by stimuli that are fear relevant in an evolutionary perspective. (b) Its activation to such stimuli is automatic. (c) It is relatively impenetrable to cognitive control. (d) It originates in a dedicated neural circuitry, centered on the amygdala. Evidence supporting these propositions is reviewed from conditioning studies, both in humans and in monkeys; illusory correlation studies; studies using unreportable stimuli; and studies from animal neuroscience. The fear module is assumed to mediate an emotional level of fear learning that is relatively independent and dissociable from cognitive learning of stimulus relationships.},

abstract = {Exposure therapy has strong empirical support as a treatment for anxiety and related disorders, yet not all participants see clinically meaningful reduction in symptoms, and some experience return of fear. In this review, we examine the theoretical models of exposure therapy, from early precursors to the contemporary inhibitory learning model. The inhibitory learning model is applied to examine one potential method of improving outcomes in exposure therapy: increasing variability in the progression of the exposure hierarchy. We explore mechanisms that support the use of variability in exposure, including the violation of expectancies to enhance learning. In addition, the role of intolerance of uncertainty in anxiety is examined; variable exposure therapy could target this transdiagnostic mechanism in anxiety and related disorders. Suggestions for future research are then offered.},

abstract = { Background. The clinician-administered version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS-CA) is a commonly used assessment device for the evaluation of social anxiety disorder and has been shown to have strong psychometric characteristics. Because of its apparently straightforward rating format and potential savings in time and effort, interest in the use of the LSAS as a self-report (LSAS-SR) measure has increased, and the LSAS-SR has been used in a number of studies. However, the psychometric properties of the LSAS-SR have not been well established.  Methods. This study examined the psychometric properties of the LSAS-SR in comparison to the LSAS-CA in a sample of 99 individuals with a primary diagnosis of social anxiety disorder and 53 individuals with no current psychiatric disorder.  Results. There was little difference between the two versions of the LSAS on any scale or subscale score. Both forms were internally consistent and the subscale intercorrelations for the two forms were essentially identical. Correlations of each LSAS-SR index with its LSAS-CA counterpart were all highly significant. Finally, the convergent and discriminant validity of the two forms of the LSAS was shown to be strong.  Conclusion. Results of this study suggest that the self-report version of the LSAS compares well to the clinician-administered version and may be validly employed in the assessment of social anxiety disorder. },

Moreover there are many distressed students who cannot, or choose not to, access professional help. The present study evaluated the efficacy of an internet-based guided self-help program for moderate anxiety, depression and stress. The program was based on standard cognitive behavior therapy principles and included 5 core modules, some of which involved options for focusing on anxiety and/or depression and/or stress. Trained student coaches provided encouragement and advice about using the program via e-mail or brief weekly phone calls. Sixty-six distressed university students were randomly assigned to either Immediate Access or a 6-week Delayed Access condition. Sixty-one percent of Immediate Access participants completed all 5 core modules, and 80{\%} of all participants completed the second assessment. On the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21, Immediate Access participants reported significantly greater reductions in depression ({\textperiodcentered}p2= 07), anxiety ({\textperiodcentered}p2= 08) and stress ({\textperiodcentered}p2= 12) in comparison to participants waiting to do the program, and these improvements were maintained at a six month follow-up. The results suggest that the provision of individually-adaptable, internet-based, self-help programs can reduce psychological distress in university students. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

It is evident from my paper that I have refuted their claims regarding each of these parts. Regarding a) Selection of studies I showed that only four studies had a cell size of less than 10 and their inclusion did not change the mean effect size or increased variability. Concerning b) Ratings of methodological quality I have showed that my ratings were reliable and had accuracy. As for c) Meta-analysis, I have demonstrated that I got very similar results to those of A-Tjak et al. (2015) that Atkins et al. describes as a much better meta-analysis.

The process provides a concrete approach for handling architecture principles, thereby bridging the gap between theory and practice. The process starts with the determination of the drivers, which are the foundation for architecture principles. In subsequent subprocesses the architecture principles themselves are determined, specified, classified, validated and applied. The application of architecture principles entails deriving more specific directives from them, as well as transforming them to diagrammatic representations. The next subprocess is using architecture principles to determine whether projects comply with the architecture. Architecture principles are positioned as the primary enablers for an effective architecture governance. The final subprocess intends to handle changes to the architecture, which may restart the initial subprocess.},

Functional analysis is tightly connected to treatment but has failed to develop testable, replicable classification systems. Functional diagnostic dimensions are suggested as a way to develop the functional classification approach, and experiential avoidance is described as 1 such dimension. A wide range of research is reviewed showing that many forms of psychopathology can be conceptualized as unhealthy efforts to escape and avoid emotions, thoughts, memories, and other private experiences. It is argued that experiential avoidance, as a functional diagnostic dimension, has the potential to integrate the efforts and findings of researchers from a wide variety of theoretical paradigms, research interests, and clinical domains and to lead to testable new approaches to the analysis and treatment of behavioral disorders.},

Both treatment groups used an Internet-delivered ACT-based treatment program and a smartphone application. Outcome measures were self-rated general and social anxiety and panic symptoms. Treatment groups saw reduced general (d = 0.39) and social anxiety (d = 0.70), but not panic symptoms (d = 0.05) compared to the waiting-list group, yet no differences in outcomes were observed between guided and unguided interventions.

abstract = {The coefficient of determination R2 quantifies the proportion of variance explained by a statistical model and is an important summary statistic of biological interest. However, estimating R2 for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called R2 GLMM for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},
